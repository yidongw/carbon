# Upload a Public 3D Model

This example demonstrates how to upload an RFQ with a 3D model through the Carbon API. Most files uploaded to Carbon aren't publicly accessible, but for 3D models, we provide a public endpoint for serving the file without standard authentication so that you can use them on your website.

### Getting Started

First run Carbon locally, and make sure your company ID and API key are set in your `.env` or `.env.local` file.

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
cd examples/upload-3d-model
npm run start
```
