## ioredis retryStrategy returning null kills auto-recovery

**Context:** Making the Redis client (`@carbon/kv`) resilient to outages (issue #1076).

**Problem:** A `retryStrategy` that returns `null` after N attempts (e.g. `if (times > 3) return null`) tells ioredis to **stop reconnecting permanently**. Once Redis is briefly unreachable the client gives up and every later command fails with "Connection is closed." even after Redis is healthy again — the app never recovers without a process restart. Command-level timeouts/try-catch cannot fix this; it is a connection-lifecycle setting. Unit tests with `ioredis-mock` do NOT catch it — only a real kill-and-restart test does.

**Rule:** For long-running servers, `retryStrategy` must keep reconnecting with capped backoff (`min(times * 200, 5000)`) and never return null. Bound per-command latency elsewhere (`maxRetriesPerRequest` + a timeout wrapper), not by abandoning reconnection. Verify recovery by stopping and restarting a real Redis, not just mocks.

**Applies to:** `packages/kv/src/client.ts`, `packages/kv/src/resilient.ts`, any ioredis client config.

## Permission scope renames are invisible to typecheck

**Context:** Renaming DB RLS policies (e.g., `plm_*` → `production_*`) as part of a module rename.

**Problem:** The app layer's `requirePermissions()` and `permissions.can()` calls use string literals like `"plm"`. These are invisible to TypeScript's type checker and linter — the rename passes all automated checks but 403s every route at runtime.

**Rule:** When renaming permission scopes, grep the ENTIRE codebase for all string literal references, not just the DB layer. Check `requirePermissions`, `permissions.can`, `usePermissions`, route loaders, and any conditional UI gating.

**Applies to:** Any permission or scope rename, `apps/erp/app/routes/`, `apps/erp/app/modules/`.

## Multi-tenancy: every query must scope by companyId

**Context:** Writing service functions that query the database.

**Problem:** Forgetting to include `.eq("companyId", companyId)` in a query exposes cross-tenant data. RLS provides a safety net, but defense in depth requires application-level scoping too.

**Rule:** Every database query in a service function MUST include `companyId` scoping. Never rely solely on RLS for tenant isolation — treat it as a backup, not the primary guard.

**Applies to:** All `*.service.ts` files, any Kysely or Supabase query.

## ValidatedForm needs the validator, not the raw schema

**Context:** Building forms with zod validation.

**Problem:** Passing a raw zod schema to `ValidatedForm` instead of wrapping it with `validator()` from `@carbon/form` results in silent validation failures — the form submits without client-side validation.

**Rule:** Always use `validator(schema)` from `@carbon/form`, not the raw zod schema. Validate with `validator(schema).validate(formData)`, not `schema.parse()`.

**Applies to:** All forms in `apps/erp/app/routes/`, `packages/form/`.

## Features live inside existing permission modules

**Context:** Building a new feature that belongs to an existing domain (e.g., assembly instructions within production).

**Problem:** Creating a standalone module enum value / permission family (`Assembly` module with `assembly_*` permissions) for something that is really part of an existing domain. Assembly instructions belong to **production**, governed by `production_<view|create|update|delete>`.

**Rule:** Don't invent a new module/permission family for a feature that fits an existing domain. Add a sub-link in the existing sidebar group (like Procedures) and a full-screen editor in its own route tree (`x+/assembly+/$id`, `handle.module: "production"`, mirroring `x+/procedure+/`). Pattern: list route under `x+/<module>+/<plural>.tsx`, full-screen editor in a sibling `x+/<singular>+/` tree whose `_layout.tsx` declares the parent module. Module folder = permission module = nav module.

**Applies to:** New features under `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/`, `apps/erp/app/modules/`.

## Assembly viewer camera + animation principles

**Context:** Camera transitions and part-motion animation in the assembly instruction viewer (`packages/viewer`).

**Problem:** Per-step re-zooming and pure-geometry view heuristics lose the "where are we on the model" context; small fasteners are invisible at assembly scale; sparse path sampling produced false "removable" results (washer/bolt ordering bugs).

**Rule (user directives):**
- **Constant zoom, rotate-only:** per-step camera transitions keep the standing whole-assembly distance and only rotate toward the action — never re-zoom per step or frame a single small part tightly.
- **Occlusion-aware angles:** choose view direction by scoring how many parts block the line of sight to the animated part (seated pose + travel midpoint), not by pure geometry heuristics.
- **Exaggerate small parts:** bolts/washers get display-only exaggerated travel (>=2.5x their size) so insertions read at assembly scale.
- **Manual motion editing is a 0.001% escape hatch:** keep it collapsed behind "Edit manually"; motions come from the geometry planner.
- **Planner correctness beats coverage:** cap sample spacing (2mm) rather than sample count. Threaded fasteners need a thread-depth penetration allowance along their own axis because CAD models them as interfering solid cylinders.

**Applies to:** `packages/viewer/`, geometry planner (`crates/planner`).

## Posting-group-style matrices are a rejected pattern

**Context:** Designing multi-jurisdiction tax determination; the spec anchored on the customerType × itemPostingGroup posting-group matrix as "Carbon precedent."

**Problem:** The posting-group matrix was deliberately REMOVED (`20260229000000_drop-posting-groups.sql`) because the indirection was confusing — but the 2023 creation migration still exists, so searches find it first and it masquerades as live precedent. Anchoring a new design on it resurrects a pattern the project already rejected.

**Rule:** Do not design N×M classification-matrix configuration (party-group × item-group → outcome). Prefer flat company defaults (`accountDefault`) plus direct per-entity assignment with per-child override (the Xero model). Before citing any schema "precedent," grep for a later `DROP`/rename migration.

**Applies to:** New config/settings design anywhere; accounting/tax/posting; `.ai/specs/`, `packages/database/supabase/migrations/`.

## Backdated migration timestamps break remote deploys

**Context:** CI `supabase db push --include-all` failed on all remotes with `column pi.balance does not exist` while applying `20260616061244`, which recreated the `purchaseInvoices` view.

**Problem:** A migration merged with a timestamp OLDER than already-deployed migrations gets applied out of order on remotes: the remote had already run `20260630095023` (drops `purchaseInvoice.balance`), so the backdated view recreation referenced a dropped column. Worse, the newer `20260630*` batch had forked its view body from a pre-fix definition, silently reverting the backdated migration's fix (`supplierShippingCost` multiply vs divide) — the backdated migration was both broken AND dead code.

**Rule:** Never merge a migration whose timestamp is older than the newest migration already on `main`/deployed. Before writing a view/RPC recreation, fork from the NEWEST definition of that view (grep all migrations, take the last). When rescuing a failed backdated migration, strip the superseded parts and re-land the still-wanted change in a fresh forward-dated migration; don't rename already-partially-applied files (re-applies them).

**Applies to:** `packages/database/supabase/migrations/`, `ci/src/migrations.ts`, any long-lived branch adding migrations.

## Never resolve a control account by number/name

**Context:** Posting intercompany invoices/payments needed the "Inter-Company Receivables" control account. The edge functions (`post-sales-invoice`, `post-payment`) fetched it with `.eq("number", "1130")`.

**Problem:** Account `number` and `name` are user-editable at any time. Resolving a control account by a hardcoded number silently mis-posts the moment someone renumbers/renames the account — no error, wrong GL account. It also duplicates a magic constant across posting paths that can drift.

**Rule:** Resolve internal/control accounts by **id** via a column on `accountDefault` scoped to the `companyId` (the same pattern as `receivablesAccount`/`payablesAccount`). If no default column exists, add one to `accountDefault` (+ seed it in `seed.data.ts` and `seed-company`, + one-time backfill migration resolving the seeded number → id), then read `ad.<xxx>Account`. The only legitimate uses of `.where("number"/"eq("number")` on `account` are: building the chart at seed time, and mapping **external** codes in an integration (e.g. Xero AccountCodes) — never resolving an internal control account at posting time.

**Applies to:** `packages/database/supabase/functions/post-*`, `close-job`, `issue`, anything posting to `journalLine`; `accountDefault` schema + `lib/seed.data.ts`.

## Chart-of-accounts group headers have no number — resolve parents by name/key

**Context:** `20260524143827_fixed-assets.sql` seeded a "Deferred Tax Expense" (7090) account for every existing company group, resolving its parent with `number = '7000' AND "isGroup" = true`.

**Problem:** Group header accounts in Carbon's chart carry `number = NULL` (they are identified by seed key/name, e.g. `other-expenses` / "Other Expenses") — only leaf posting accounts have numbers. The lookup silently returned NULL and the account was inserted with `parentId = NULL`, leaving it orphaned at the root of the chart for every pre-existing company. New companies were unaffected because `seed.data.ts` parents via `parentKey`. The bug is invisible in dev (fresh seeds go through `seed.data.ts`) and only shows on long-lived databases.

**Rule:** In migrations that insert `account` rows, resolve the parent group by `"isGroup" = TRUE AND name = '<Group Name>'` (optionally + class), never by number — and treat a NULL parent as an error or explicit fallback, never insert silently orphaned. `20260630093809_ar-ap-payments.sql` is the correct precedent. When a past migration did orphan accounts, ship a follow-up UPDATE re-parenting `parentId IS NULL` rows to the group `seed.data.ts` assigns (see `20260702192816`).

**Applies to:** `packages/database/supabase/migrations/` touching `account`; `packages/database/supabase/functions/lib/seed.data.ts`; anything walking the chart-of-accounts tree.

## Never fabricate a "best-effort" motion through geometry

**Context:** The assembly motion planner (`crates/planner/src`) had a tier-4 "forced removal" that gave unsolvable parts a straight-line motion through whatever blocked them, so every part animated. On the seat-rail assembly 6/30 parts got 48–647mm fly-through motions early in the sequence — the whole animation read as wrecked.

**Problem:** A fabricated path is worse than no path: it renders as a collision, erodes trust in every other step, and hides the real geometric finding (interlocked unit, embedded solid, missing mate exemption) behind a fake answer.

**Rule:** When a solver can't prove a result, emit an explicit flagged state (`motion: "none"` + `blockedBy` + warning) and give the UI a degraded-but-honest rendering (fade-in at the seated pose). Never ship a fabricated approximation of a geometric/physical claim. Same for display fallbacks: an AABB "least-blocked direction" guess may only be used where it's labeled as a guess, never silently for planner output.

**Applies to:** `crates/planner/src`, `packages/viewer` (fallback.ts, AssemblyPlayer), `generateAssemblyStepsFromPlan`.

## Penetration tolerances must stay far below sample spacing

**Context:** The planner allowed 1.5mm "thread depth" penetration along a fastener's axis versus ALL parts, with collision samples every 2.0mm, to make solid-thread models removable through their nuts.

**Problem:** Tolerance ≈ spacing means a thin blocker (1mm washer, flange, cover) can pass between samples entirely below the allowance — the part "removes" through solid metal, which scrambles the greedy disassembly order downstream. A blanket allowance also applies to parts that have nothing to do with the threads.

**Rule:** Scope allowances to the specific mating pair that justifies them (fastener ↔ its detected threaded mate, capped at the seated interference + margin), keep the global tolerance an order of magnitude below sample spacing, and locally refine sampling near any contact that approaches the tolerance.

**Applies to:** `crates/planner/src` collision sampling; any sampled sweep/clearance check.

## trimesh CollisionManager rebuilds BVHs on every single-object query

**Context:** Re-planning the 31-part seat rail took ~2 hours; the old planner took ~59s. `manager.in_collision_single(mesh, transform)` builds a fresh FCL BVH for the queried mesh on EVERY call, and the greedy loop also removed/re-added parts per attempt (another BVH rebuild each).

**Rule:** For sampled sweeps, cache the FCL BVH per mesh (`mesh_to_BVH` once, `fcl.CollisionObject` per query) and collide against `manager._manager` directly; never remove/re-add a manager object to "exclude" it — filter its contacts by name with an infinite allowance instead. Bound sampling by the AABB separation distance (beyond it, disjointness is provable).

**Applies to:** `crates/planner/src` (`_contacts_at`, `_self_exempt`), any trimesh/fcl sampling loop.

## Don't pre-sign a short-lived upload URL before a long-running operation

**Context:** `assembly-plan` pre-signed a `createSignedUploadUrl` for `plan.json`, then called the geometry `/plan` service which ran the motion planner (~3 min) and finally PUT the result to that URL. Uploads 400'd and the job stuck in `Processing` forever; the ERP UI polled "Solving motions…" indefinitely.

**Problem:** Supabase `createSignedUploadUrl` mints a **60-second** token and the SDK gives no way to extend it (it only honors `{ upsert }`; the TTL is a storage-server setting). By the time a multi-minute planner finished, the token had expired → `400 InvalidJWT "exp claim timestamp check failed"` → the service returned 502. The fast `/convert` path (~16s) never tripped it, so the pattern looked fine. Re-runs/"already exists" are a red herring — an upsert PUT to an existing object returns 200.

**Rule:** A pre-signed **upload** URL must be consumed within ~60s of minting. For any operation that can outlast that, don't hand the worker a pre-signed PUT URL — have the service **return the artifact inline** and let the worker persist it with the service-role client the moment it has the bytes (no token, no expiry). Also bound the outbound `fetch` with `AbortSignal.timeout(...)` so a hung service fails cleanly (→ `onFailure` marks the row Failed) instead of pinning it in `Processing`.

**Applies to:** `packages/jobs/src/inngest/functions/tasks/assembly-plan.ts`, `apps/assembler/src/main.rs` (`/plan`); any Inngest task that pre-signs storage upload URLs before a slow external call.

## Direct psql DDL needs a PostgREST schema-cache reload

**Context:** Applied an unshipped migration's delta (drop `assemblyGroup`, create `assemblyUnit`) to the local DB with `psql` instead of `crbn migrate`, to avoid a full rebuild. The ERP page then hung: the `$id` loader's `Promise.all` timed out (`fetchWithRetry` TimeoutError) even on queries against unrelated tables.

**Problem:** PostgREST caches the DB schema. `crbn migrate` / `db:migrate` reload it after applying migrations; a raw `psql` DDL does not. With a stale cache, queries against the changed tables can't resolve and hang, which exhausts the connection pool and times out *other* queries too. (Confirmed after: `assemblyGroup` returned PGRST205 "Could not find the table in the schema cache".)

**Rule:** After any direct-psql schema change to a local Supabase DB, reload PostgREST — `psql -c "NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';"` (or `docker restart <...>-postgrest-1`). Prefer `crbn migrate` when possible; when patching by hand (e.g. editing an unshipped migration in place), the reload is a required follow-up.

**Applies to:** any local schema change applied outside `crbn migrate`; symptom is loader/REST timeouts after a DDL patch.

## Synthetic box meshes fake huge penetration under sustained sliding contact

**Context:** Writing planner ordering tests (`test_part_with_blocked_insertion_is_not_demoted`) with raw `trimesh.creation.box` parts: a slider seated 0.05mm into a channel floor read as depth **29.8mm** against the rail at every sweep sample, so the planner declared it inseparable and rigid-merged it.

**Problem:** FCL reports per-triangle-pair local penetration. A box face is two giant triangles; two near-coplanar giant triangles overlapping 0.05mm in the normal direction report a depth spanning their tangential overlap. Real STEP models never hit this — tessellation at `linearDeflection` keeps triangles small, so local depths stay bounded by element scale. The artifact only appears in synthetic tests whose parts sustain face-on-face sliding contact; brief seated contact that separates immediately (stacked boxes lifting off) is fine.

**Rule:** In planner tests, any part that must SLIDE while touching another needs `mesh.subdivide_to_size(5.0)` on both meshes — and prefer seating the moving part against a face perpendicular to its travel (contact vanishes on the first sample) over a face parallel to it (contact persists the whole sweep). Also avoid geometry where a seated bite must scrape past an opening sill: that is a real interference, not an artifact.

**Applies to:** `crates/planner/tests` synthetic fixtures; debugging any "cannot separate / planned as one rigid unit" result on hand-built trimesh geometry.

## Ordering heuristics must be gated on a large noisy model, not just the seat rail

**Context:** The weakly-secured-last + sandwich-gasket refactor validated green on 47 unit tests and a byte-identical 31-part seat-rail baseline, then made real planning slower with worse results. A 20-line classification probe on the 118-part SA Mando & Battery Harness immediately showed why: 4 sandwich detections — ALL false positives, including a 33mm "thin" part (ratio-only thinness cap) and two 10.4mm isotropic pass-through allowances (uncapped observed depth granted as "compliant squish").

**Problem:** The seat rail is a best-case model: named fasteners, clean contacts, no ambiguous plate stacks. Proxy signals calibrated there (name-only fastener detection, contact counts, thinness ratios) explode on models with unnamed hardware, clearance fits, and interpenetrating CAD. Two failure classes: (1) a *preference* wired into the greedy removal priority is not a preference — that ranking schedules expensive removal attempts and picks flag/merge victims, so fronting hard-to-remove parts multiplies failed sweeps (slower); (2) any heuristic that grants collision allowances fails open — one false positive corrupts collision truth for every sweep it touches (worse).

**Rule:** Before shipping a planner ordering/allowance heuristic: (a) run the classification-only probe (`.ai/scratch/geometry-probe.py`) on a large noisy model (harness/BCU class) and eyeball every cohort member and every allowance value — a 10mm "squish" is a bug, not a gasket; (b) keep display preferences in the topo sort only, never in `removal_priority`; (c) cap and axis-gate anything that relaxes collision tolerance, and prefer fail-closed (reject classification) over fail-open (grant allowance) when evidence is out of range.

**Applies to:** `crates/planner/src` ordering preferences, `_sandwiched_parts`-style classifiers, any future exempt/allowance mechanism.

## Profile the planner before optimizing — the flood was pass-through, not self-collision

**Context:** Motion planning took ~3 min (seat rail) / >30 min (harness). A micro-benchmark showed a 2,000× per-sample cost for a part colliding with its own seated copy (it stays registered in the manager), so the "obvious" fix was to unregister the moving part during its own sweeps. Implemented, byte-identical output — and **zero real-model speedup** (191→211s). cProfile told the truth: 86% of total time was `_contacts_at` under `_path_blockers`, dominated by **pass-through enumeration** — sweeping a part THROUGH its blockers enumerates the blocker's full triangle-contact set (53M contact objects on a 31-part model) at every sample for the whole travel, when all `_path_blockers` needs is each blocker's identity, discovered once.

**Problem:** Micro-benchmarks measure the mechanism you built them around, not the workload. Self-collision flooding is real but self-overlap ends early in most sweeps; deep pass-throughs persist for hundreds of samples and were the actual cost. The two look identical from the outside (both are "too many contacts").

**Rule:** For planner performance work, cProfile the real model FIRST (`cProfile.run('plan_step(...)')` — 30s of setup) and read cumtime by caller before choosing a lever. The winning fix: in `_path_blockers`, once a partner is recorded as a blocker, unregister it from the broadphase for the remainder of the sweep and re-register before returning (`registerObject`/`unregisterObject` on the SAME CollisionObject rebuilds nothing — the BVH lives on the geometry). Seat rail 191–211s → 20–26s (8×), harness >30min → 9.5min, byte-identical sequences. Keep the self-unregister too (it's what makes the synthetic test suite 8× faster), but don't mistake it for the fix.

**Applies to:** `crates/planner/src` sweep functions (`_path_blockers`, `_contacts_at`, `_unregistered`); any future "collect all X along a path" collision query.

## Verify what actually rendered before root-causing a "bad motion" report

**Context:** A user reported step 4's screw+washer "colliding through the 3D MARKETING and seat rail clamp" and asked for a motion-planning refactor. A trimesh/FCL sweep of the STORED motion against the real GLB meshes showed it was collision-free against the entire model — and the only geometrically feasible insertion (the reverse sense jams the washer into the clamp bore by 3.4mm). The visible garbage came from elsewhere: a re-motion job was still running, so steps played stale/"none" motions through the collision-blind AABB display fallback, on top of 26 never-installed components being rendered solid.

**Problem:** A "the animation collides" report conflates at least four layers: the stored plan motion, the display-time fallback synthesis (`displayMotionForStep` → `synthesizeFallbackMotion`), display adjustments (`exaggerateMotion`), and the visibility model (what else is on canvas). Root-causing the planner first is attacking the strongest layer — the geometry service's motion had `verified: true` and meant it.

**Rule:** Before touching planner code for a visual-collision report: (1) check `assemblyPlanJob.status` — Queued/Processing means the user watched placeholder motions; (2) dump the step's stored `motion` from `assemblyInstructionStep` and sweep it against the GLB (the `collision` crate, or a small trimesh script; storage files live in the storage container under `/var/lib/storage/stub/stub/<bucket>/...`); (3) only if the stored motion itself collides is it a planner problem — otherwise it's fallback/visibility/display-layer work in `packages/viewer`.

**Applies to:** assembly-instruction motion bug reports; `packages/viewer/src/{motion,fallback,AssemblyPlayer}`; `crates/planner/src`.

## GLB node↔nodeId joins must be validated against graph.json bboxes

**Context:** Building BCU acceptance fixtures from the viewer GLB: nodeIds live in glTF node `extras` which trimesh drops, so the join went through world-transform matching. The geometry service bakes vertices in world space with identity node transforms — every node "matched" position (0,0,0) and the assignment silently scrambled 431 parts. The resulting degree/volume table looked plausible ("Seal Electronics Box, degree 19, 742cm³") and drove two wrong fix iterations before the graph.json bboxes exposed it.

**Problem:** A shuffled mesh↔name assignment still produces plausible-looking planner output — garbage in, plausible garbage out. Name-prefix or transform heuristics have no error signal of their own.

**Rule:** When joining GLB scene nodes to graph.json nodeIds, match on world BBOX against graph.json's per-leaf bbox (authoritative, written by the same converter) and assert coverage (all nodes matched, max error < 1mm) before trusting any downstream analysis. `/tmp`-fixture recipe: parse the GLB JSON chunk for extras + walk scenes for world matrices, then bbox-match to trimesh geometry.

**Applies to:** acceptance/repro scripts over viewer GLBs; any offline analysis pairing `graph.json` with `model.glb`.

## Name-only fastener classification: "pin" and spec suffixes mark structure as hardware

**Context:** The SA BCU's enclosure is named "Electronics Box - 36 Pin" (a connector pin COUNT). The fastener name regex matched `\bpin\b`, classifying the box as hardware: removal priority fronted it (fasteners first → expensive failed sweeps → flagged early), base candidacy excluded it, and the assembly sequence anchored on a gasket. One word in a part name inverted the entire build order.

**Problem:** Fastener detection is name-only; real CAD names carry fastener-ish tokens in structural parts (pin counts, "M8 slot pattern" spec suffixes). A false positive is fail-open: it changes scheduling, exemptions, and base selection everywhere at once.

**Rule:** Never classify on ambiguous single tokens — "pin" is out (dowel pins still match via "dowel"). Back the name test with physical sanity in `_classify_fasteners`: a name-matched part spanning more than `max(100mm, 0.35 × assembly diagonal)` keeps its structural role. When ordering goes absurd on a new model, print the `fasteners` cohort first — one misclassified structural part explains a scrambled sequence.

**Applies to:** `crates/planner/src` (`FASTENER_NAME_RE`, `_classify_fasteners`, `removal_priority`, `_reselect_base`); future classification heuristics.

## Client-side entity caches must be company-keyed in a multi-tenant app

**Context:** A prod company export failed its closure guard: a `salesOrder` (and its `opportunity`) in one company referenced another company's customer. Root cause chain: `RealtimeDataProvider` (ERP + MES) cached the customer/item/supplier/people lists in IndexedDB under **global** keys (`"customers"`), and company switching is a client-side navigation — so after a switch, the previous company's cached list could hydrate the pickers before the properly-scoped server fetch landed. Nothing downstream caught the bad pick: zod validated `customerId` as a bare string, services inserted it blindly, RLS only checks the row's own `companyId`, and the FK was single-column (`customerId → customer(id)`).

**Problem:** Any client cache (IndexedDB/localforage, localStorage, nanostores hydrated from them) that isn't keyed by `companyId` becomes a cross-tenant leak the moment a multi-company user switches companies without a full reload. Multi-company users legitimately pass RLS for both companies, so no server layer notices.

**Rule:** (1) Key every persisted client cache entry by company (`customers:${companyId}`) and guard async hydration callbacks against mid-flight company switches. (2) Tenant-scoped references between tables should be composite FKs `(refId, companyId) → parent(id, companyId)` so the DB rejects cross-company refs from every write path (see `20260703143904_composite-tenant-fks.sql`, which converts customer/supplier refs introspectively and tolerates pre-existing bad rows via NOT VALID + warning).

**Applies to:** `apps/{erp,mes}/app/components/RealtimeDataProvider.tsx`, `apps/erp/app/stores/*`, any new client-side cache; migrations adding FKs to company-scoped parents.

## Never feed a nullable user id into a NOT NULL audit column from a DB function

**Context:** A live demo failed to record production quantities, backflush materials, or complete the job. `sync_update_job_operation_quantities` auto-flipped the operation to `Done` without stamping `updatedBy`; `sync_finish_job_operation` then passed `p_new->>'updatedBy'` (NULL) as `p_user_id` into `complete_job_to_inventory`, whose `itemLedger` insert violated `createdBy NOT NULL` (23502) and rolled back the entire cascade. A sweep found the same latent bug in `sync_purchase_invoice_line_price_change` (payload `updatedBy` → NOT NULL `purchaseInvoicePriceChange.updatedBy`) — right next to a migration that had fixed the adjacent trigger for exactly this reason.

**Problem:** `updatedBy` is nullable on every table, and trigger/interceptor UPDATEs don't go through the app layer that normally stamps it. So `p_new->>'updatedBy'`, `NEW."updatedBy"`, and `p_user_id DEFAULT NULL` params are all NULL-able user sources; writing them into a NOT NULL `createdBy`/`updatedBy`/`postedBy` makes the whole transaction (including the user's original write) roll back with 23502. The failure is invisible in testing whenever the row happens to have been user-updated before.

**Rule:** In SQL functions: (1) any UPDATE issued by a trigger/interceptor that other interceptors may react to must stamp `"updatedBy"` (from the payload's `createdBy`/`updatedBy`) and `"updatedAt"`; (2) never write a payload user field into a NOT NULL column without a fallback — `COALESCE(p_new->>'updatedBy', p_new->>'createdBy')` (`createdBy` is NOT NULL on source tables); (3) functions taking `p_user_id` that write audit columns must not default it to NULL, or must guard right after `BEGIN` with a fallback to the entity's `createdBy` (see `20260706182830_fix-null-user-audit-columns.sql`). When forking a large function to add such a guard, extract the newest body verbatim (sed) and diff-verify instead of retyping.

**Applies to:** `packages/database/supabase/migrations/` — all `sync_*` interceptors and any PL/pgSQL function writing `createdBy`/`updatedBy`/`postedBy`; reviews of new event-system interceptors.

## A LANGUAGE sql set-returning function's internal ORDER BY is not guaranteed through PostgREST

**Context:** `get_available_tracked_entities` (a `LANGUAGE sql STABLE` set-returning function) was extended with a `p_sort_method` param and a CASE-based `ORDER BY` (FEFO/FIFO/LIFO) to power an on-the-fly picking suggestion. FEFO worked, but calling the RPC for FIFO returned rows in the wrong order — its only effective sort key was the trailing `te."createdAt" ASC`, which came back unordered. Adding an explicit outer `ORDER BY "createdAt"` at the call site fixed it, proving the function's internal order was being dropped.

**Problem:** The Postgres planner **inlines** simple `LANGUAGE sql` functions into the calling query; when the caller (here, PostgREST via `client.rpc(...)`) supplies no outer `ORDER BY`, the inlined subquery's `ORDER BY` can be optimized away. Ordering that leads with a real indexed/leading column (expiration for FEFO) may survive by luck; ordering whose only key is a trailing column silently does not. Unit tests and typecheck can't catch this — only real-data querying does.

**Rule:** Do not rely on a `LANGUAGE sql` set-returning function's internal `ORDER BY` to reach the app. Either (a) sort authoritatively in the app after the RPC returns (return the sort columns and order in TS — see `apps/mes/app/services/allocation.ts` `sortLotsByPickMethod`, applied in `getSuggestedAllocationForMaterial`), or (b) if ordering must live in SQL, use `LANGUAGE plpgsql` with `RETURN QUERY ... ORDER BY` (plpgsql is never inlined). Always verify RPC ordering against seeded real data, not just unit tests.

**Applies to:** `packages/database/supabase/migrations/` set-returning `LANGUAGE sql` functions consumed via `client.rpc(...)`; any app code that greedy-fills / picks "the first row" from an RPC result.

## Tracked consumption/split must book against the entity's ACTUAL bin, not an arbitrary ledger row

**Context:** Building "return unused picks at job complete" surfaced a pre-existing bug in the `issue` edge function (`trackedEntitiesToOperation`). Consuming a batch that had been picked to a lineside shelf booked the Consumption + split `itemLedger` rows against `itemLedgers.find(il => il.trackedEntityId === id)?.storageUnitId` — the FIRST row for the entity in a `createdBy`-ordered list, i.e. an arbitrary bin. A picked entity has ledger rows in BOTH its warehouse source and its lineside bin, so consumption landed on the warehouse bin, leaving the entity at −N on-hand in one bin / +N in another: a per-bin-negative, internally inconsistent ledger, and the un-consumed remainder (a split entity) stranded on the wrong bin.

**Problem:** For a tracked entity that has moved between bins (pick/transfer), "which bin holds the stock" is NOT the first ledger row — it's the bin whose net on-hand is positive. Picking any row's `storageUnitId` silently misplaces consumption and breaks any downstream feature that reasons about physical location (e.g. returning lineside remainder to source).

**Rule:** When booking a consumption/split/movement ledger row for a tracked entity, resolve the storage unit from **net on-hand per bin** (the bin with the highest positive net), never `.find(...)?.storageUnitId` over an unordered/`createdBy`-ordered list. See `resolveTrackedEntityBin` (`packages/database/supabase/functions/issue/resolve-tracked-entity-bin.ts`, pure + `deno test`-covered). Scope such a fix to the path you can verify — the same `.find` pattern exists in other cases (e.g. `unconsumeTrackedEntities`); don't blanket-replace untested paths.

**Applies to:** `packages/database/supabase/functions/issue/index.ts` and any edge function inserting `itemLedger` rows for a tracked entity that may hold stock in multiple bins.

## Biome does not apply 3rd-level nested configs — enforce Deno via an override

**Context:** Bringing Supabase edge functions (`packages/database/supabase/functions/**`, Deno) into Biome's lint surface for the new `noConsole` rule. These files sit outside the linted globs (`apps/*/app/**`, `packages/*/src/**`) and were never Biome-formatted.

**Problem:** A dedicated nested `functions/biome.jsonc` (root:false, formatter off, noConsole only) is silently ignored. Biome applies the depth-1 nested config (`packages/biome.jsonc`) for the whole `packages/` subtree; a depth-2 nested config under it never governs — the `format` diagnostic keeps appearing and `formatter.enabled:false` has no effect. Letting `packages/biome.jsonc` (which `extends "//"`) govern the Deno files directly produces ~270 CI-failing errors (Deno globals → `noUndeclaredVariables`, `useImportType`, `organizeImports`, formatting) on never-linted code.

**Rule:** Do not rely on 3-level Biome config nesting. Add the target path to the depth-1 config's `files.includes`, then scope an `overrides` entry there (glob relative to that config) that turns off `formatter`/`assist` and the Node-oriented error rules (`correctness.noUndeclaredVariables`, `noUnusedVariables`, `style.useImportType`) while inheriting the one rule you want (`noConsole` as a warning). Verify with `pnpm exec biome check --reporter=summary <dir>` expecting 0 errors. See `packages/biome.jsonc`.

**Applies to:** `biome.jsonc` / `packages/biome.jsonc` rule scoping; any attempt to lint Deno edge functions or other non-`src/` trees.

## React Router v7 middleware `next()` never rejects on thrown Responses/errors

**Context:** Writing `requestIdMiddleware` (`@carbon/logger`) that sets an `x-request-id` header on the response after `await next()`, and worrying that thrown redirects/`data()` from loaders/actions would skip the header.

**Problem:** It is easy to assume `next()` propagates the thrown redirect/error (route handlers DO `throw redirect(...)`), which would mean post-`next()` response mutation is skipped on those paths. That assumption is wrong and leads to defensive try/catch that isn't needed.

**Rule:** In RR v7 middleware (`callRouteMiddleware`, react-router dist), `next()` wraps the downstream chain in try/catch and **resolves** with `errorHandler(error)`'s Response — it only rejects if `request.signal.aborted`. So mutating headers on the resolved response after `await next()` correctly covers redirects and error (500) responses; only aborted requests skip it, which is fine (client is gone). Register the middleware first so downstream runs inside its `withContext`/ALS scope.

**Applies to:** any RR v7 `middleware`/`clientMiddleware` that reads or mutates the response after `next()`; `packages/logger/src/middleware.server.ts`, `packages/auth/src/middleware/*`.

## Composite (`id, companyId`) FKs break PostgREST `alias:column(...)` embeds

**Context:** RFQ supplier linking silently failed — `getPurchasingRFQSuppliersWithLinks` / `getPurchasingRFQSuppliers` (`purchasing.service.ts`) returned an empty `suppliers` array even though the `purchasingRfqSupplier` row existed, so the Properties multiselect never showed linked suppliers and an optimistic add reverted on revalidation.

**Problem:** The embed `.select("*, supplier:supplierId(id, name)")` uses the `alias:foreignKeyColumn(...)` disambiguation form. That only resolves when `supplierId` is a **single-column** FK. Multi-tenant FKs here are **composite** — `purchasingRfqSupplier_supplierId_fkey FOREIGN KEY ("supplierId","companyId") REFERENCES supplier(id,"companyId")` — so PostgREST returns `PGRST200: Could not find a relationship ... 'supplierId' ... Perhaps you meant 'supplier'`. The whole query errors, `data` is null. Loaders that do `result.data?.map(...) ?? []` (and never check `result.error`) swallow it as "no rows". Same bug hit the nested `supplier:supplierId (*)` inside `supplierQuote:supplierQuoteId(*, ...)` for linked-quote reads.

**Rule:** For a composite-FK relationship, embed by **target table name** — `.select("*, supplier(id, name)")` (or the explicit constraint `supplier:supplier!purchasingRfqSupplier_supplierId_fkey(...)`), never `alias:fkColumn(...)`. Verify a PostgREST embed against the running REST API (`/rest/v1/<table>?select=...` with the service-role key) — PGRST200 is a schema-cache error returned even on empty tables. And when a loader powers UI state, check `.error`, don't `?? []` a failed query into silent emptiness.

**Applies to:** any supabase-js embed on a join table with a composite `(entityId, companyId)` FK — `purchasingRfqSupplier`, `supplierQuote.supplierId`, and siblings; `apps/erp/app/modules/purchasing/purchasing.service.ts`.

## Dual-major deps of workspace source packages crash the SSR bundle when the shared dep is externalized

**Context:** Merging assembly instructions (#1075) added `@carbon/viewer` (a source-only workspace package) with `@react-three/fiber@8`, whose ESM dist does `import create from 'zustand'` against its own nested zustand v3. The app + `@react-three/drei` use the catalog zustand v5, which removed the default export.

**Problem:** Production (app.carbon.ms) 500'd on every request while builds stayed green. Vite/rolldown inlines deps of linked workspace packages into the SSR bundle but externalizes packages resolvable from the app root **by package name**, merging fiber's v3 default import with v5 named imports into one `import ste,{create,...}from"zustand"` in `build/server/index.js`. Node resolves that to v5 at runtime → `SyntaxError: The requested module 'zustand' does not provide an export named 'default'` at `ModuleJob._instantiate` — before any code runs, so the error never reaches error reporting, dev SSR never reproduces it (per-importer resolution), and Vercel previews show READY (crash is invocation-time). The runtime log dumps a random window of the minified bundle (logtape's timezone formatter), which reads like an Intl/timezone error — red herring.

**Rule:** When a dep of a workspace source package pins a different major of a package the app also depends on, add that package to `ssr.noExternal` in the consuming apps' `vite.config.ts` so each importer keeps its own inlined copy. Verify with a build + `grep -E "from *[\"']zustand" build/server/**` (expect no bare imports) and `node --input-type=module -e "await import('.../build/server/index.js')"` — reaching an env-var error proves linking succeeded. For any all-requests-500 Vercel incident with a minified source dump, read the **last** lines for the real error and check `node:internal/modules/esm/module_job` in the stack before believing anything the dumped source suggests.

**Applies to:** `apps/erp/vite.config.ts`, `apps/mes/vite.config.ts` `ssr.noExternal`; any new dep of `@carbon/viewer` or other source-only workspace packages (`@carbon/form`, `@carbon/onboarding`, ...) that pins an older major of a shared package.

## `@ts-expect-error TS2589` on Supabase joined-selects is fragile — flips "used/unused" as files are added

**Context:** The `$itemId.purchasing.$supplierPartId.delete.tsx` routes (material / tool / consumable / part / …) each do `client.from("supplierPart").select("id, supplierId, supplier:supplierId(name)")`. Some carried `// @ts-expect-error TS2589 — … type instantiation too deep`. Adding an unrelated new route file (`periods.generate.tsx`) flipped which file the checker reported: `material` went from TS2578 (unused directive) to clean, `tool` went from clean to TS2589 — a whack-a-mole that broke `erp` typecheck without touching those files.

**Problem:** TS2589 ("type instantiation is excessively deep") on PostgREST joined-select types is **order/threshold dependent** — it surfaces at whichever file crosses a cumulative-depth limit during a given check pass, so which file errors changes as files are added/removed elsewhere. `@ts-expect-error` *requires* an error on the next line, so a directive that was "used" becomes an "unused directive" (TS2578) the moment the trigger moves — and the newly-triggering file now lacks a directive (TS2589). Swapping directives just moves the problem.

**Rule:** Don't manage TS2589 on Supabase joined-selects with `@ts-expect-error` — it *requires* an error, so it flips to TS2578 the moment the trigger moves to another file. Use `@ts-ignore` instead (the codebase's choice on the `supplierPart` delete routes): it suppresses the error when it fires and stays green when it doesn't, and it preserves the inferred `result` type. A localized `(client as any)` cast is the heavier alternative — it removes the file from the cumulative-depth pool entirely but drops the result's type; prefer `@ts-ignore` unless you specifically need to break the inference chain.

**Applies to:** the `supplierPart` joined-select delete routes and any similar `alias:fkColumn(...)` embed that trips TS2589; `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/{material,tool,consumable,part}+/...delete.tsx`.

## Changing `seed.data.ts` only reaches NEW companies — existing companies need a reconciling migration

**Context:** The period-close checklist changed (dropped "Close the period", reclassified two Auto/Manual tasks to Action). Those edits went into `packages/database/supabase/functions/lib/seed.data.ts` (+ `seed-company` / `seed-dev`), which only run on **company creation**. Existing companies — seeded by the original migration's `INSERT … FROM company` — kept the old task set, so the fixes never reached them.

**Problem:** Seed data (`seed.data.ts` + `seed-company`) and migration-time seeds (`INSERT … FROM company`) are two different populate paths. Editing the former fixes new companies; existing companies are frozen at whatever the migration inserted. The two silently drift.

**Rule:** When you change seeded per-company template rows (`periodCloseTaskDefinition`, `paymentTerm`, `accountDefault`, …) in `seed.data.ts`, also write an idempotent **reconciling migration** for existing companies (`INSERT … FROM company … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`, plus deletes for removed rows), guarded on the `system` user for the `createdBy` FK. Validate it in a rolled-back psql txn that simulates the old state. Deleting instance rows to force re-instantiation is fine when no real data depends on them (confirm first).

**Applies to:** any change to `packages/database/supabase/functions/lib/seed.data.ts` per-company templates; `seed-company/index.ts`, `seed-dev.ts`.

## meshopt vertex codec requires a stride that is a multiple of 4 — i16 VEC3 normals break it

**Context:** `crates/optimize` quantizes normals to i16 (SHORT, normalized) to shrink the optimised GLB, encoding each attribute as its own `EXT_meshopt_compression` vertex buffer. An i16 VEC3 normal is 6 bytes, so the normal view was emitted with `byteStride: 6`. The GLB reparsed and round-tripped fine through the Rust `meshopt` decoder, and all crate tests passed.

**Problem:** `meshopt_encodeVertexBuffer`/`decodeVertexBuffer` require the vertex size be a **multiple of 4** (`assert(vertex_size % 4 == 0)`); the Rust binding doesn't assert in release, so it emitted a 6-byte-stride stream that only its own decoder round-trips. The spec-compliant JS `MeshoptDecoder` (three.js / `three-stdlib`) rejects it with `Malformed buffer data: -2`, so the viewer showed a black screen — and because the failure is inside the decoder, no obvious app-level error surfaced. Positions (stride 12) and indices were fine; only the 6-byte normal stream broke.

**Rule:** Any attribute encoded as a meshopt vertex buffer must have a stride divisible by 4. Pad i16 VEC3 normals to i16 VEC4 (8 bytes, 4th lane `0`) — the accessor stays VEC3 (reads x,y,z; the 8-byte stride skips the pad) and the constant pad lane compresses to ~nothing. Never trust "reparses + Rust-decoder round-trips" as proof a meshopt GLB is valid; validate against the spec JS decoder (`GLTFLoader.setMeshoptDecoder`). The regression test `quantized_normals_keep_meshopt_stride_multiple_of_four` asserts every `ATTRIBUTES` view stride is `% 4 == 0`.

**Applies to:** `crates/optimize/src/lib.rs` (`ViewData`, the meshopt assemble path); any new quantized attribute type added to the optimiser; the `@carbon/viewer` `useAssembly` loader that consumes these GLBs.

## Large text `.gltf` with an embedded base64 buffer can't be serde-parsed bounded — stream it into a GLB

**Context:** The assembler optimises uploaded models. Text `.gltf` (the Onshape export shape) carries its single geometry buffer as a base64 `data:` URI. `optimize_gltf` did `serde_json::from_slice(gltf_bytes)` then base64-decoded the URI. GLB (`optimize_glb`) was already bounded — its BIN chunk is a `&[u8]` slice into the mmap.

**Problem:** For a 1.73 GB `.gltf`, serde materialises the base64 as an owned ~1.73 GB `String`, then base64-decode allocates ~1.3 GB more — both live at once → ~3 GB peak. mmap doesn't help because serde copies the string out of the mapped bytes. The assembler failed with "source file exceeds the size limit" (a separate cap) and, once that was lifted, was on track to OOM on parse.

**Rule:** Don't serde-parse a glTF whose buffer is a giant base64 data URI. Repack `.gltf` → `.glb` first with a **streaming** base64 decode: walk the JSON with `struson` (`transfer_to` copies the small structural fields verbatim, dropping the buffer's `uri`), then `next_string_reader()` the base64 value through `base64::read::DecoderReader` straight into the GLB BIN chunk on disk. Then mmap the `.glb` and use the already-bounded `optimize_glb` path — geometry never heaps. Verify decoded length == the buffer's declared `byteLength` (fail loud, never emit a corrupt GLB). `crates/optimize::gltf_to_glb` + `apps/assembler` `load_source` (`Format::Gltf` → repacked temp `.glb` → `Src::MappedTemp`).

**Applies to:** `crates/optimize/src/lib.rs` (`gltf_to_glb`; `optimize_gltf` was removed), `apps/assembler/src/actions/optimize.rs` (`load_source`, `run_optimize` — every source is GLB now); any new large-text-JSON asset with an embedded base64 blob.
## Raw-SQL item fixtures break type-specific UI — Material items need a companion `material` row keyed by readableId

**Context:** Posting-flow verification created a type-`Material` item (RM-STEEL) with a raw `INSERT INTO "item"`. Interceptors auto-created `itemCost`/`itemReplenishment`/etc., so purchasing and posting worked. Later, selecting that material on a part's BOM (`/x/part/{id}/details?materialId=…`) crashed the whole page with "Not Found".

**Problem:** Type-specific detail RPCs join companion tables the interceptors do NOT create: `get_material_details` requires a `material` row joined via `material."id" = item."readableId"` (readableId, not item id — all revisions share one taxonomy row). The properties route throws `404` when the RPC returns nothing, and a fetcher 404 bubbles to the route error boundary, taking down the entire details page.

**Rule:** When creating item fixtures via SQL, create the type's companion row too (`material` keyed by `readableId` for Materials; check the `get_{type}_details` RPC joins for the type). Prefer creating fixtures through the UI or service functions when the item will be used in UI flows, not just ledger posting.

**Applies to:** any psql/SQL test-fixture item creation; `get_material_details` / `get_part_details` / `get_tool_details` consumers; `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/items+/$itemId.properties.tsx`.

## Journal debit/credit is derived from account class + amount sign, not the raw sign

**Context:** Seeding a Cash sale as a journal via SQL, I used Cash (Asset) `amount = +1000` and Sales (Revenue) `amount = -1000`, assuming `+ = debit, - = credit` (which the `journal` AGENTS.md states for the *stored* value). The `journalEntries` view then reported the entry as `totalDebits = 2000, totalCredits = 0` — unbalanced — and the period-close "Trial balance in balance" auto-check (`tb-balanced`) refused the close.

**Problem:** `journalEntries.totalDebits`/`totalCredits` are computed from **account class AND amount sign**: Asset/Expense `amount>0` OR Liability/Equity/Revenue `amount<0` → debit; the mirror → credit. So a *positive* amount on a Revenue account is a **credit**, not a debit. A correctly-balanced sale is Cash (Asset) `+1000` and Sales (Revenue) `+1000` — both positive. The raw `SUM(amount)` the balance RPCs use is a separate, class-agnostic signed sum; don't conflate the two.

**Rule:** When hand-seeding `journalLine` rows, set the sign to move the account toward its natural balance: `+` increases an Asset/Expense (debit) and increases a Liability/Equity/Revenue (credit). Verify against the `journalEntries` view (`totalDebits == totalCredits` per `journalEntryId`) before relying on the data — an unbalanced entry silently blocks period close. Posted `journal`/`journalLine` rows are immutable (`journal_posted_immutable` / `journalLine_posted_immutable`); to correct seeded mistakes you must disable those triggers on the local DB (superuser), never in a migration.

**Applies to:** any SQL journal fixtures; the `journalEntries` view; the `tb-balanced` close check in `computePeriodReadiness` (`accounting.service.ts`).

## A period snapshot written at close races Locked-period postings unless the posting guard locks the period row

**Context:** `closeAccountingPeriod` writes the `accountingPeriodBalance` snapshot inside its transaction, after flipping the period to `Closed`. `check_accounting_period_open` only *rejects* postings when a period is already `Closed`; a `Locked` period still accepts them (Locked is a soft freeze for adjustments). A period only becomes Closed on COMMIT.

**Problem:** In the window between the close txn's snapshot `SELECT` and its COMMIT, a concurrent posting reads the period as still-Locked (the flip is uncommitted under READ COMMITTED), is allowed, and commits a line with `postingDate <= endDate` that the snapshot never captured. The read path's delta only adds `postingDate > endDate`, so that line is silently dropped from the optimized balance until reopen+reclose — a wrong financial figure with no error.

**Rule:** When a cache/snapshot is written inside a state-flip transaction and a concurrent writer keys off the *committed* state, make the writer take a lock that conflicts with the flip. Here: the posting guard reads the target `accountingPeriod` row `FOR SHARE` (migration `20260713235930`), which blocks behind the close's row lock — postings before the flip commit first (and land in the snapshot); postings after block, then see `Closed` and are rejected. `FOR SHARE` is shared, so normal concurrent postings don't block each other; only an in-flight close serializes them. Verify with two psql sessions + `lock_timeout`.

**Applies to:** `check_accounting_period_open`; `snapshotAccountingPeriodBalances` / `accountingPeriodBalance`; any close/snapshot-on-commit pattern.

## Inline-editable table cells commit on blur — the container must own navigation keys in the capture phase

**Context:** Inventory count table (PR #1135 follow-up): typed Counted Qty values were lost on Tab/Enter (only click-away saved), Enter never navigated, arrows stepped the number instead of moving the selection, and keyboard nav went dead after a commit.

**Problem:** Editable cells (`~/components/Editable/*`) persist via the input's native `onBlur`, but three things prevent that blur from ever firing on keyboard navigation: (1) the Table's key handler `preventDefault()`s Tab/Enter, so the browser never moves focus; (2) React unmounts the still-focused input when the selection moves, and browsers fire no blur on a removed element; (3) react-aria's NumberField swallows Enter entirely (`onKeyDownEnter` commits internally without `continuePropagation()`) and consumes ArrowUp/Down as spinbutton steps, so a bubble-phase table handler never sees those keys. Blurring at the input level without navigating drops `document.activeElement` to `body`, after which the table wrapper hears no further keys.

**Rule:** The table container owns the Excel keyboard model: attach the handler with `onKeyDownCapture` (so it beats react-aria to Enter/arrows), `stopPropagation()` for handled keys while editing, blur `document.activeElement` to commit *before* `setSelectedCell`, and let the roving-tabindex cell ref (`useMovingCellRef`) refocus the newly selected cell. Skip events targeting portaled overlays (`[data-radix-popper-content-wrapper]`, `[role=menu|listbox|dialog]`) — those own their keys. Editors must keep blur as their *single* commit path (no keydown commits — they double-fire the mutation, as `EditableText` did in Grid).

**Applies to:** `apps/erp/app/components/Table/Table.tsx`, `apps/erp/app/components/Grid/Grid.tsx`, `apps/erp/app/components/Editable/*`, any future inline-editable cell editor.

## Seeding useState from a prop goes stale when the document flips state in place

**Context:** After Rectify flipped a Posted inventory count back to Draft, the lines table stayed read-only until a full page reload.

**Problem:** `Table` read `forceEditMode` only as the `useState` initial value. Rectify/Post actions revalidate the route in place — the component never remounts, so the prop change never reached the state, and the Edit/Lock toggle is hidden while `forceEditMode` is set, leaving no way to recover. The same staleness applied in the opposite direction after posting a Draft (table looked editable on a read-only document).

**Rule:** When a prop derives from a document's mutable status (Draft/Posted etc.) and controls interaction mode, sync it with an effect (`useEffect(() => setEditMode(forceEditMode), [forceEditMode])`) or derive it instead of seeding state once. Test the transition without a reload — loader revalidation does not remount components.

**Applies to:** `apps/erp/app/components/Table/Table.tsx` (`forceEditMode`), any component seeding state from status-derived props on revalidating routes.

## journalLineDocumentType and itemLedgerDocumentType are different enums with near-identical value sets

**Context:** Adding GL posting for inventory adjustments: journal lines needed a `documentType` of `'Inventory Adjustment'`, and the plan also stamped the same value onto `itemLedger`/`costLedger` rows.

**Problem:** `journalLine.documentType` uses the `journalLineDocumentType` enum while `itemLedger.documentType` AND `costLedger.documentType` share the `itemLedgerDocumentType` enum. The two lists overlap heavily ('Inventory Count' exists in both) but are not identical — `'Inventory Adjustment'` existed in neither and was added only to `journalLineDocumentType`. Writing a journal-only value into a ledger column fails at runtime with an invalid-enum error, and stamping a new documentType onto manual-adjustment `itemLedger` rows would also have broken the "byte-identical ledger writes when accounting is disabled" guarantee (they are NULL today).

**Rule:** Before using a `documentType` string, check WHICH enum the target column uses (`\dT+` or grep the migration) — never assume the journal and ledger enums share values. When adding GL posting to an existing subledger flow, keep the subledger rows' shape unchanged (documentType stays whatever it was, usually NULL) and put the new linkage value on the journal lines only.

**Applies to:** `packages/database/supabase/migrations/` enum additions; `functions/shared/post-adjustment.ts`; any `post-*` function writing both `itemLedger`/`costLedger` and `journalLine`.

## Deno edge functions are not deno-check-clean — gate on own-file error deltas, not exit code

**Context:** Verifying new/edited Supabase edge functions (`post-inventory-adjustment`, `post-inventory-count`) with `deno check`.

**Problem:** `deno check` on ANY edge function fails with ~10–20 pre-existing errors from the shared dependency graph (TS2589 in `shared/get-next-sequence.ts`, kysely pool-config type skew, supabase-js generic inference collapsing to implicit-any callbacks). CI never runs `deno check`, so committed, working functions fail it — a red exit code proves nothing about the change, and chasing those errors means rewriting shared files out of scope.

**Rule:** Gate edge-function changes on the DELTA of errors attributed to the touched file: `deno check <file> 2>&1 | sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g' | grep -c "<file>:"` must not exceed the committed baseline (copy the HEAD version beside it to measure, e.g. `git show HEAD:<path> > <dir>/index.orig.ts`, check, delete). New code should contribute zero; annotate supabase-js callbacks with explicit row types instead of leaving implicit-any. Pure logic goes in a small module importing only `lib/types.ts` so `deno test` type-checks clean.

**Applies to:** `packages/database/supabase/functions/**` verification; `.claude/skills/check-and-commit` runs touching edge functions.

## Forking a SQL function migration silently drops sibling branches added since your fork base

**Context:** `complete_job_to_inventory` gained a Non-Inventory branch in `20260707022142` (services post WIP→COGS, no inventory artifacts). Six days later, two migrations (`20260713190909` raw-materials split, `20260713222236` overhead fix) each forked the function from the older `20260630092517` baseline — silently deleting the Non-Inventory branch. Service job completions then posted phantom Finished Goods until the branch was restored in `20260714043017`.

**Problem:** "Fork from the newest definition" fails when the author greps for the migration that matters to *their* change and misses intermediate redefinitions that added orthogonal branches. The dropped branch produces no error — the divergent behavior only surfaces when someone exercises the other feature.

**Rule:** Before redefining a function, list EVERY migration that touches it (`grep -l '<fn_name>' migrations/*.sql | sort`), and fork from the last one — then diff your new body against that exact file (`diff <(sed -n 'a,bp' newest.sql) <(...)`) so the only hunks are your intended edits. If the timeline shows a branch you don't understand (an `itemTrackingType` guard, a feature flag), it is load-bearing — carry it forward, never re-derive the body from an older file or memory.

**Applies to:** `packages/database/supabase/migrations/` — any `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` fork; reviews of migrations that redefine shared functions (`complete_job_to_inventory`, `backflush_job_materials`, `get_inventory_quantities`, sync interceptors).

## Job-completion side effects must live in complete_job_to_inventory, not in route actions

**Context:** Service-job fulfillment (advance the linked salesOrderLine on completion) was first implemented in the ERP `$jobId.complete.tsx` action after the RPC call. In e2e it never ran: the operator finished the last operation, and `sync_update_job_operation_quantities` → `sync_finish_job_operation` (DB interceptors) called `complete_job_to_inventory` directly — the ERP route was never involved.

**Problem:** Job completion has multiple entry points — the ERP Complete button AND the interceptor cascade that auto-completes when the last operation flips to Done (fired from MES quantity recording or ERP production quantities). Any completion side effect hooked at the app layer silently misses the interceptor path.

**Rule:** Side effects that must accompany job completion (fulfillment, status propagation, posting) go INSIDE `complete_job_to_inventory` — the single choke point every path crosses. Place them before the `accountingEnabled` / zero-WIP early returns if they must run unconditionally. App-layer completion hooks are only valid for effects the SQL function cannot perform (edge-function invocation — cf. `returnAllocatedRemaindersAtJobComplete`, orchestrated in TS for exactly that reason).

**Applies to:** `complete_job_to_inventory`; `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/job+/$jobId.complete.tsx`; `sync_finish_job_operation`; any future completion-triggered behavior (rev-rec POC recognition events).

## A `@ts-expect-error` on generated DB types is evidence of a dropped column, not a type quirk

**Context:** `InventoryTable.tsx` read `row.original.tags` behind a `// @ts-expect-error TS2339`. The suppression was correct that the property was missing — `20260713235406` had forked `get_inventory_quantities` and dropped the `tags` output added by `20260113122437` (the sibling-branch failure mode above). The regression then hid in plain sight for months: the Tags column silently rendered empty, and the Tags filter sent `.overlaps("tags", …)` → PostgREST 42703 against a nonexistent column.

**Problem:** Generated types are mechanically derived from the live schema, so TS2339 on a generated Row/Returns type is never a false positive — it is the type system reporting that the column does not exist. Suppressing it converts a compile-time regression signal into a silent runtime one. The blast radius was widened by `quantities.tsx` calling `redirect(...)` without `throw`, which discarded the resulting PostgREST error and rendered an empty table instead of surfacing it.

**Rule:** Never `@ts-expect-error` / `@ts-ignore` a missing property on a `@carbon/database` generated type. Grep every migration touching the function or table (`grep -l '<name>' migrations/*.sql | sort`) and find the revision that removed it — the fix is a migration restoring the column, not a suppression. When reviewing, treat a `@ts-expect-error` near generated types as a probable dropped-column regression. Corollary: in a loader, always `return` or `throw redirect(...)` on a service error — a `redirect(...)` that is neither returned nor thrown is a no-op that swallows the error and renders empty data.

## A mutually-exclusive primary/fallback branch breaks when the primary source can be legitimately empty

**Context:** The MES Issue dialog (`IssueMaterialModal`) pre-selects tracked lots from two sources: `pickedAllocation` (lots a picking list already picked) and `suggestedAllocation` (the FEFO/pickMethod suggestion of what to pick). It gated the suggestion off whenever a picking allocation merely existed (`shouldSuggestAllocation = … && !hasPickingAllocation`) and chose `seedAllocation = hasPickingAllocation ? pickedAllocation : suggestedAllocation`.

**Problem:** `hasPickingAllocation` was true when `quantityToPick > 0` — i.e. the material is ON a picking list — but `pickedAllocation` is only non-empty once something is physically PICKED (pickingListLineTrackedEntity rows are written at pick time, never at allocation). For a material on an In-Progress list that hasn't been picked yet (common in a multi-line list where other lines were picked first), the primary branch was selected but resolved empty, the suggestion was gated off, and the seed effect bailed → operator got the default first lot instead of the recommendation. The two conditions "should we prefer picked lots" and "do picked lots exist" were conflated.

**Rule:** When one data source is the preferred seed and another is the fallback, branch on whether the preferred source actually HAS data (`primary.length ? primary : fallback`), and load the fallback unconditionally — do not gate the fallback off on a proxy signal (here `hasPickingAllocation`) that can be true while the primary is still empty. Verify the "primary exists but is empty" state explicitly, since it's the one static reading and happy-path testing both miss.

**Applies to:** `apps/mes/app/components/JobOperation/components/IssueMaterialModal.tsx` (picked vs suggested allocation seeding); any picking-list-aware UI that distinguishes allocated-but-not-picked from picked (`pickingListLineTrackedEntity.quantityPicked > 0`).

## PostgREST inserts NULL (not the DB default) for a present-but-`undefined` key spread into an insert

**Context:** Creating a Fixed Asset sales-order line failed with `23502 null value in column "methodType" violates not-null constraint`, even though `salesOrderLine.methodType` is `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Pull from Inventory'`. The validator (`salesOrderLineValidator`) intentionally coerces the form's empty `methodType` to `undefined` for Fixed Asset / Comment lines (`zfd.text` + a refine that exempts them). The action spreads `...validation.data` into `upsertSalesOrderLine`, whose insert path spreads `...salesOrderLine` — so the object still carries `methodType: undefined`. A raw psql insert omitting the column succeeded (used the default); the app's PostgREST insert did not.

**Problem:** `postgrest-js` builds its `?columns=` list from `Object.keys(row)`, which **includes keys whose value is `undefined`**. `JSON.stringify` then drops the value from the body, so PostgREST sees the column listed with no value and inserts `NULL` — it does **not** fall back to the column `DEFAULT`. A truly absent key (never spread, e.g. `id`) is excluded from `?columns=` and does get its default. This is why the sibling **update** path was fine: it runs `sanitize(...)`, which strips `undefined`/empty keys before the write. Only the **insert** path (which didn't sanitize) leaked the `undefined` key.

**Rule:** When spreading validated/optional data into a supabase-js `.insert(...)`, a NOT-NULL column with a DB default will still fail if the key is present-but-`undefined`. Either (a) supply the value explicitly at the insert site next to the other defaults (`methodType: x.methodType ?? "Pull from Inventory"`), (b) `sanitize(...)` the insert object so undefined keys are dropped (matches the update path), or (c) pass `{ defaultToNull: false }` to `.insert(...)` (sends `Prefer: missing=default`). Prefer (a) for a single column, (b) for consistency with an existing update path. Don't assume the DB `DEFAULT` will apply — it only does for keys entirely absent from the object.

**Applies to:** `upsertSalesOrderLine` (`apps/erp/app/modules/sales/sales.service.ts`); any `upsert*` whose insert branch spreads optional/validated fields into a table with NOT-NULL-DEFAULT columns (sales/purchase/quote/invoice line inserts especially, which all carry a NOT NULL `methodType`).

## Twin `ValidatedForm`s at the same JSX slot share one RVF store — controlled-field defaults seed only for whichever branch mounts first

**Context:** The Add Affected Item modal (`AffectedItemForm`) renders `isNewPart ? <ValidatedForm A/> : <ValidatedForm B/>`. Branch A (New Part) has `replenishmentSystem`/`itemTrackingType` Selects with `defaultValues` `"Make"`/`"Inventory"`; branch B (existing item) has an item picker. After switching to New Part the two Selects rendered blank and submit failed with `Invalid enum value … received ''`.

**Problem:** Both branches render a `<ValidatedForm>` (same element type) at the **same JSX position**, so React reconciles them as **one component instance** and just swaps props — no unmount/remount. `@carbon/form`'s RVF store seeds `controlledFields.values` from `defaultValues` **only on first hydration** (`syncFormProps`: `if (!state.isHydrated) { … }`). The instance hydrates on the initial branch (B, `changeType` default `Version`), so when the user switches to A, A's Select defaults are **never** seeded — `useControlledFieldValue` returns the store value (`undefined`) once `isHydrated`, not the `defaultValue`. Uncontrolled fields (`InputControlled`) were unaffected because they write their own value via effect. `defaultValues` object identity was a red herring: `ValidatedForm` already `useDeepEqualsMemo`s it, and `syncFormProps` ignores later `defaultValues` changes post-hydration.

**Rule:** When two `ValidatedForm`s occupy the same conditional slot (`cond ? <VF/> : <VF/>`), give each a distinct, stable `key` (`key="new-part"` / `key="existing-item"`) so switching forces a fresh mount + fresh store that hydrates with the correct branch's `defaultValues`. Consequence: the fresh mount also needs any Select value the branch relies on seeded in its own `defaultValues` (e.g. `changeType: "New Part"`, added to `changeOrderNewPartValidator`) — a value the shared store previously carried over from the user's click is gone after remount. Symptom to watch for: a controlled Select rendering blank / submitting `""` right after a branch switch.

**Applies to:** `apps/erp/app/modules/items/ui/ChangeOrder/AffectedItemForm.tsx`; any conditional twin-`ValidatedForm` pattern; `@carbon/form` controlled fields (`Select`/`Combobox`/anything on `useControlField`) that rely on `defaultValues` seeding.

## A public SECURITY DEFINER function that calls net.http_post is a remote-DoS surface — put it in an internal schema

**Context:** The push-based event-queue wake (`20260721184852_event-queue-wake.sql`) originally defined `wake_event_queue()` / `sweep_event_queue()` in the `public` schema. Both are SECURITY DEFINER and call `net.http_post` (pg_net) to POST to the `event-wake` edge function. The trigger (`dispatch_event_batch`) and pg_cron call them as the owner (superuser).

**Problem:** Every `public` function is auto-exposed as a PostgREST RPC (`/rest/v1/rpc/<name>`), reachable by `anon`. Worse than mere exposure: referencing such a function as a **non-superuser** role segfaults the backend (pg_net 0.20 / PG15) — reproducible via `SET ROLE authenticated; EXPLAIN SELECT public.wake_event_queue();`, which crashed even though `EXPLAIN` never runs the body and the role lacked EXECUTE. The crash happens at plan/permission-resolution time, **before** the ACL check — so `REVOKE ALL … FROM PUBLIC, anon, authenticated` does NOT protect: an unauthenticated `POST /rpc/wake_event_queue` crash-loops the whole DB (postmaster reinitializes all backends → "database system is in recovery mode" for every client). Same-body call as superuser was fine, which is why the trigger/cron paths worked and masked it in end-to-end testing.

**Rule:** Never define an internal SECURITY DEFINER helper (especially one calling `net.http_post` / pg_net) in `public`. Put it in the internal `util` schema (the existing Carbon/Supabase convention — cf. `util.process_embeddings`), where `anon`/`authenticated` have no `USAGE`, so the API can't reference it at all and a hostile call fails cleanly with `permission denied for schema util` before any crash-prone planning. Callers that are triggers/pg_cron run as owner and reach `util` fine; update their bodies to `util.<fn>()`. Keep `REVOKE ALL … FROM PUBLIC` on the util function as defense-in-depth, but the schema-USAGE gate is the real fix. Verify with `SET ROLE authenticated; SELECT util.<fn>();` → must be a clean `permission denied`, not a dropped connection. Note PostgREST-exposed schemas exclude `util`/`pgmq` but include `public`/`net` (`has_schema_privilege('anon', <schema>, 'USAGE')`).

**Applies to:** any new SECURITY DEFINER function that calls pg_net/`net.http_post` or is meant to be trigger/cron-only (`packages/database/supabase/migrations/`). Trigger functions returning `trigger` are not RPC-exposed (safe in public), but VOID/scalar helpers are.

## The local Inngest dev server (v1.19.4) can't handle `debounce` — it errors on every debounce item

**Context:** The push-based event-queue drainer (`packages/jobs/src/inngest/functions/events/queue.ts`) was configured with `debounce: { period: "2s", timeout: "10s" }` to coalesce bursts of `carbon/event-queue.process` wake events into one run.

**Problem:** The Dockerized dev server (`inngest/inngest:v1.19.4`, run by `crbn up`) logs `error unmarshalling debounce item: json: cannot unmarshal array into Go struct field DebounceItem.e.data of type map[string]interface {}` on every debounced event, fails to coalesce (a 20-write burst produced 21 runs, not ~1), and spams the error each time the function is triggered (including every pg_cron sweeper tick). Fails open — events still process, queue still drains, nothing is lost — but the optimization is absent in dev and the logs are noisy. Inngest Cloud honors debounce; the dev server does not.

**Rule:** Don't rely on `debounce` for Carbon Inngest functions validated against the local dev server — it's broken there. For the event queue the coalescing was moved upstream: `dispatch_event_batch()` wakes at most once per transaction (txn-local GUC `carbon.event_wake_sent`), so the important bulk case (a CSV import = one transaction) is already one wake; `concurrency: 1` + loop-until-empty drain absorbs the rest (extra runs from many separate transactions are cheap no-ops that read an empty queue). If you must coalesce many *separate* transactions in a burst, do it at the DB/application layer, not with `debounce`. Verify any flow-control choice by watching `docker logs <inngest container>` for `error handling queue item` during a burst, not just by trusting the config.

**Applies to:** `packages/jobs/src/inngest/functions/events/queue.ts`; any new Inngest function reaching for `debounce`/flow-control that will be exercised in local dev.
