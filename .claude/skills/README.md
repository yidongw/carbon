# Carbon skills — index

Source of truth for agent skills (tracked in git). Copied into `.codex/skills/`
by `.ai/scripts/install-skills.sh` (runs on `pnpm prepare`; manually:
`pnpm install-skills`). Authoring rules: `writing-skills/SKILL.md`.

## Pipelines

**Feature** (phased, human gates at spec + plan):

```
/research → /spec-writing → /plan → /execute → /test → /self-review
                 🛑 open questions      🛑 plan approval
```

`/feature` runs this pipeline. At start it picks an **autonomy mode**
(approval-before-each-phase vs fully autonomous — autonomous auto-resolves the
🛑 gates and records the decision) and a **phase set** (`/plan` + `/execute` are
mandatory; research, spec, test, self-review are optional, auto-detected from
the request), and keeps a run record at `.ai/runs/{date}-{slug}.md`.
`/spec-writing` resolves its Open Questions via `/grill`. `/execute` commits per
task via `/check-and-commit`.

**Bug fix**:

```
/root-cause → (/debugging-difficult-bugs if runtime evidence needed) → fix (implements) → /test → /check-and-commit
```

`/fix` runs this pipeline end-to-end: it orchestrates the diagnosis and
verification phases **and** implements the fix itself (the minimal change plus a
red→green regression test). At start it picks an **autonomy mode**
(approval-before-each-phase vs fully autonomous — autonomous auto-resolves the
conditional branches and records each choice) and a **phase set** (root-cause +
fix are mandatory; runtime instrumentation is conditional on confidence, test is
optional, commit runs only on explicit ask), and keeps a run record at
`.ai/runs/{date}-{slug}.md`. The two 🛑 hard stops (architectural three-strikes
in root-cause, BLOCKED in fix) always surface to the human.

**Autonomous loop** (single scoped item, doer→gate→judge, no mid-loop human input, gated PR): `/conductor`.

**Advisory audit** (read-only, produces handoff plans): `/improve`.

| `pr-splitter` | Split a large PR into reviewable stacked PRs | branches + split notes |
| `ui` | Remote-managed UI exploration shim (uidotsh) | — |
| `agent-browser` | External: browser CLI reference (pinned in `skills-lock.json`) | — |
| `make-interfaces-feel-better` | External: UI polish principles (pinned in `skills-lock.json`) | — |

## Conventions every skill follows

- Workflow skills announce themselves at start ("Using the {name} skill — …")
  so the human always knows which playbook is running.
- Typecheck is always scoped: `pnpm exec turbo run typecheck --filter=<pkg>`.
  Whole-repo typecheck OOMs — no skill may prescribe it.
- `pnpm run generate:types` after any migration, before typechecking.
- Commits only through `/check-and-commit` (explicit file staging, conventional
  messages); push only when the branch tracks a remote or the user asked.
- Ephemeral output (screenshots, debug logs) goes to gitignored `.ai/scratch/`,
  never into tracked trees.
- `agent-browser` + `make-interfaces-feel-better` are external skills pinned in
  `skills-lock.json` — update them via their upstream, don't edit in place.
