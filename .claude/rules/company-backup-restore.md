# Company Backup / Restore / Onboarding Seed

Per-company logical backup, in-place restore (with revert), and onboarding-seed
from a committed demo template. **Inngest tasks, NOT edge functions** — the old
`import-company` / `finalize-import` / `revert-import` edge functions and the
`company-revert` / `publish-demo` / `refresh-demo-catalog` jobs were deleted; this
is the replacement. Reader-facing docs: `docs/content/docs/platform/backups.mdx`
(kept deliberately impl-free — keep internals here, not there).

User-facing rules of the feature: backups require `settings` update permission
(no owner gate — the old `group.ownerId === userId` check was removed from both the
route and the `export-company` edge function), exclude secrets, and a restore is
reversible via an auto-snapshot.

**Currently internal-only** (`isInternalEmail`, `@carbon/utils`) while the
multi-tenant caveats below are unhardened: the nav entry is in `internalOnlyRoutes`
(`useSettingsSubmodules.tsx`), and `requireInternal` (route loader/action) plus both
`api+/settings.backup-*` loaders 404/redirect non-internal users. Internal =
`@carbon.ms` / `@carbon.us.org`. Drop the gates to ship publicly.

## Shared engine — `company-backup.ts`

The catalog is **schema-introspected**, not a hand-maintained list:

- `getCompanyTableCatalog(sql)` reads `information_schema` for every public BASE
  TABLE carrying a `companyId` or `companyGroupId` column, builds `TableInfo`
  (columns, FK edges, `scopeColumn`, `hasId`/id type), and topologically sorts
  (referenced-first). **`companyId` wins** when a table has both columns.
- `scopeColumn: "companyId" | "companyGroupId"`. `companyId` = the company's own
  data; `companyGroupId` = config shared across a company group (chart of
  accounts, currencies, dimensions).
- Skip/scope sets: `SECRET_TABLES` (`apiKey`, `apiKeyRateLimit`,
  `companyIntegration`, `webhook`, `oauthClient`, `oauthToken` — never travel;
  `apiKeyRateLimit` is here because its NOT-NULL `apiKeyId` references the stripped
  secret `apiKey`, so exporting it alone would dangle every row on restore — and
  it's UNLOGGED operational counters, not user data), `STRUCTURAL_TABLES` (`company` —
  excluded from catalog), `TRANSIENT_TABLES` (`demandForecastSource`,
  `demandActual`, `supplyForecast`, `supplyActual` — MRP planning output the
  `mrp` edge fn regenerates wholesale every run; excluded from the catalog
  entirely alongside `STRUCTURAL_TABLES`, so they're never exported/wiped/loaded
  and the next MRP run rebuilds them. `demandForecastSource`'s discriminator
  CHECK (`sourceType` ↔ which of `jobId`/`salesOrderLineId`/`demandProjectionId`
  is non-null) made a remapped restore crash — the FK-nulling dangling-ref policy
  in `buildRowTransforms` nulls a set FK and violates the CHECK. `demandForecast`
  is deliberately kept: it has a user-forecast write path and no such CHECK. The
  two excluded sets are unioned into `CATALOG_EXCLUDED_TABLES`, which
  `assertBackupImportable` also skips — an OLDER backup that still carries an
  excluded table is not schema drift, its rows are just ignored on load),
  `RESEED_SKIPPED_TABLES` (memberships/invites/employee/externalIntegrationMapping
  — skipped on onboarding reseed), `IN_PLACE_SKIPPED_TABLES` (access/identity
  tables a restore must keep so the user isn't locked out).
- Format: the gz is **NDJSON** — line 1 is `{ manifest }`, every later line is one
  `{ t, r }` table row. Written/read a line at a time (`serializeBackup` /
  `deserializeBackup` in `company-backup.ts`) so a large backup never materializes
  as one `>512MB` string (V8's max) nor a single giant `JSON.parse`. The old
  whole-file `{ manifest, data }` JSON broke at ~512MB of row data.
- Versioning: `BACKUP_VERSION` (currently **1** — single supported format, no
  legacy branch) in the manifest; `assertBackupImportable` rejects a file whose
  version no longer matches or that's missing a now-required column.
- Id minting: `newIdForTable(table)` → `randomUUID()` for uuid id columns else
  `nanoid()`. Id remap is **gated to text/uuid id columns** (serial/int ids are
  left alone).
- Storage path rewriting: `rewriteStoragePath` (swap `{sourceCompanyId}/` →
  `{targetCompanyId}/` + remapped id segments), `rewriteToTemplateAssetPath`
  (`{co}/…` → `_templates/{industryId}/…`). `STORAGE_PATH_COLUMNS` =
  `modelPath`, `thumbnailPath`.
- Asset transport: `copyAssetsToBackup` (server-side `storage.copy`
  of `private/{companyId}/…` files into a backup's `.assets/` folder) and
  `restoreAssetsFromBackup` (copy them back to `private/`, rewriting paths +
  guarding every write to the target `{companyId}/` prefix). `removeStoragePrefix`
  recursively deletes a backup's `.assets/` folder. `backupAssetPrefix(gzPath)`
  derives `exports/<name>.assets` from `exports/<name>.carbon.json.gz`
  (`BACKUP_GZ_SUFFIX`). Copies are server-side — **no asset bytes pass through the
  job process**, so memory stays flat regardless of asset size.

Buckets (important, two different things):
- `STORAGE_BUCKET = "private"` — the **shared** bucket holding every company's
  uploaded assets under a `{companyId}/` prefix.
- The **per-company bucket named by `companyId`** holds the backup `.gz` files
  (`exports/<name>.carbon.json.gz`), each backup's sibling `.assets/` folder of
  copied storage files (`exports/<name>.assets/{companyId}/…`), and pre-restore
  snapshots — see `client.storage.from(companyId)`.
- `TEMPLATE_BUCKET = "company-templates"`, `TEMPLATE_ASSET_PREFIX = "_templates"`.

## Export — `company-export.ts`

Dumps each catalog table scoped by its scope column into a **data-only** NDJSON gz
(`serializeBackup`, line-streamed). **Empty tables are skipped**
(`if (result.rows.length === 0) continue`) — so a backup of a company with no GL
postings simply has no `journalLine`/`costLedger` rows; that is data-absence, not a
coverage gap. With `includeStorage: "all"`, `buildCompanyBackup` records the
in-scope asset paths in `manifest.storage` and returns them; the job then
`copyAssetsToBackup` them server-side into the backup's `.assets/` folder.
- **Progress/failure marker**: one `externalIntegrationMapping` row per company
  (`integration = "company-export"`, no run id — exports are one-at-a-time per
  company). The job writes `{ status: "running", startedAt, progress }` heartbeats
  (throttled 250ms), **clears the marker on success** (the new backup appearing in
  the list is the completion signal), and **flips it to
  `{ status: "failed", error }` on error** — it is NOT cleared on failure; a
  cleared marker made a broken export indistinguishable from one that never ran.
  The failed marker is dismissed from the UI via the `dismissExportFailure`
  intent → `dismissCompanyExportFailure` (service role — the table has no DELETE
  policy), and the next export's `upsertExportMarker` reuses the row.
- **Asset cap** (`company-export.ts`): no per-file cap (the bucket already bounds
  uploads — 120MB CAD, 50MB docs; the `private` bucket's own limit is the dev
  `50MiB` global in `config.toml`), only a `MAX_STORAGE_TOTAL_BYTES = 1GiB` guard on
  the whole backup. Files are included greedily until the budget is hit; each is
  recorded in `manifest.storage` with `included: true|false`. The cap is storage-cost
  only (server-side copy is memory-flat) — each backup duplicates the bundled bytes.
  The old `25MiB`-per-file / `200MiB`-total caps silently dropped legit large media.

## Restore — `company-restore.ts`

Three Inngest fns: `companyRestoreFunction`, `companyRestoreFinalizeFunction`,
`companyRestoreRevertFunction`. **Shared concurrency** key
`'company-restore-' + event.data.companyId`, scope `env`, limit `1` — one restore
per company at a time.

Forward flow:
1. `downloadBackup` from the per-company bucket; `deserializeBackup` (streamed
   NDJSON gunzip — never a single `>512MB` string).
2. Compute `targetGroupId`, then `groupCompanyCount` (count of companies with that
   `companyGroupId`). `includeGroup = groupCompanyCount === 1`. A **foreign**
   backup (`manifest.sourceCompanyId !== companyId`) onto a shared group
   (`!includeGroup`) **throws** rather than rewrite the shared chart of accounts.
3. Auto-snapshot current state to `snapshotPath` (idempotent — reuses an existing
   one). This is what `revert` restores.
4. `wipeAndLoad` in ONE transaction with `session_replication_role = 'replica'`
   (relaxes FK checks during load):
   - `selectWipeableTables(catalog, { includeGroup })` → company-scoped tables
     minus kept/secret; group-scoped tables included **only** when `includeGroup`.
   - `wipeScopedData` deletes each table in reverse-topo order, **always** scoped
     `WHERE <scopeColumn> = <value>`; a null scope value is skipped (no unscoped
     DELETE is possible).
   - `buildRowTransforms` re-stamps `companyId`→target, `companyGroupId`→
     `targetGroupId`; on a foreign/remap load it mints new ids (text/uuid only) and
     remaps FKs, with a dangling-ref guard (nullable FK → null, non-nullable →
     throw).
   - Closure preflight (`assertReferentiallyClosed` → `findDanglingReferences`)
     runs before the wipe and refuses a backup whose NOT-NULL FK points at a row
     it doesn't include. It tracks a parent's ids for **any table with an `id`
     column**, not only `hasId` (sole-`id` PK) tables — the ~25 composite
     `("id","companyId")`-PK tables (`stockTransfer`, `supplierPart`, …) are
     referenced by their `id` too, and gating on `hasId` falsely flagged every
     child of them and refused otherwise-valid restores. It also skips
     `SECRET_TABLES` on both sides (a secret table is never written to a backup
     and never loaded) — an OLDER backup that predates a table joining
     `SECRET_TABLES` still carries its rows (e.g. `apiKeyRateLimit` → the stripped
     `apiKey`); they're ignored on load, so the preflight ignores them too.
5. `restoreAssetsFromBackup` (outside the txn, non-transactional) copies the files
   from the backup's `.assets/` folder back to `private/<rewritten path>`,
   server-side. It runs **before** the `ready` marker (step below) so the progress
   dialog only reports "complete" once data AND files are in place — but it never
   throws (per-file warnings), so a storage hiccup still can't fail a committed
   restore. Every write is guarded to the target `{companyId}/` prefix.
6. State marker → `ready` (data committed + files copied).
7. `assertWipeSafe(catalog)` guards the invariant that a KEPT table has no NOT-NULL
   FK into a WIPED table.

State marker: a row on `externalIntegrationMapping`, `integration =
"company-restore"`, `metadata = { status: running|ready|failed|reverting,
snapshotPath, foreign, includeGroup }`. `revert` reads the marker and reloads
`snapshotPath` (using `metadata.includeGroup`). Status is polled by the UI.

### Known caveats in the committed code (not yet hardened)

- **Storage restore is best-effort** — copy failures `console.warn` only; the
  restore still reports success (data is the source of truth). The cross-tenant
  write guard (`targetPath.startsWith(\`${companyId}/\`)`) IS now in
  `restoreAssetsFromBackup`.
- **Asset copy duplicates bytes** — a self-contained backup copies the company's
  assets into its `.assets/` folder, so each backup costs roughly its asset size in
  storage. Snapshots are transient (their `.assets/` is removed on keep/revert);
  exports persist until deleted (`deleteCompanyBackupExport` removes the folder).
- **`company-import` id-gate drift** — restore gates id remap on column type
  (text/uuid); import still uses a `typeof row.id === "string"` heuristic. Share
  one transform builder to fix.
- Sequences: the only pg-native serials on backed-up tables are `entryNumber` on
  `itemLedger`/`costLedger`/`supplierLedger` (not PKs, not unique; PKs are all
  text). They are **global/shared across tenants** — never `setval` them scoped to
  one company; in-place restore needs no reset (other tenants hold the high-water
  mark).

## ERP layer

- `backups.service.ts` — per-company bucket ops: `exportCompanyBackup`,
  `listCompanyBackups` (`from(companyId).list("exports")` folders; a folder is
  "ready" once `manifest.json` exists, else "pending"), `deleteCompanyBackup`
  (removes the whole `exports/<name>/` folder), `getCompanyRestoreRuns` (restore
  markers), `getCompanyExportRun` (the export marker: `status:
  "running" | "failed"`, `progress`, `startedAt`, `error`).
- `backups.server.ts` — server-only trigger wrappers (`startCompanyRestore`,
  `finalizeCompanyRestore`, `revertCompanyRestore`) plus
  `dismissCompanyExportFailure` (service-role delete of the failed export
  marker) — kept off the client to avoid `Buffer`-in-client.
- `routes/x+/settings+/backups.tsx` — **internal-gated** (`requireInternal`)
  loader/action (export / restore / keep / dismiss / revert / delete /
  dismissExportFailure intents). `filePath` is forced under `exports/`. Export is
  **non-blocking, row-first** (Supabase-style): clicking "Create backup" does NOT
  open a modal — it drops a synthetic "Creating backup…" spinner row into the
  Backups list **immediately** (optimistic client state `runningExport`, set the
  instant the action returns `started: "export"`, before the job writes its first
  marker), and clicking that row opens the detail progress modal. `runningExport`
  is also **adopted from the marker** on mount for a run started elsewhere
  (reload / another tab); its `baseline` = ready backups when tracking began, and
  completion = a ready backup outside the baseline appearing in the revalidated
  list (page revalidates every 2.5s while the modal is closed). A "failed" marker
  renders a banner ("The system created an invalid backup — please contact Carbon
  support." + error) with a Dismiss button; "pending" folders with no tracked
  export are labeled "Incomplete backup — not restorable" (never "Preparing…").
- `routes/api+/settings.backup-summary.ts` — lazy "what's in a backup" counts,
  grouped, per-entity `scope: company|group`.
- `routes/api+/settings.backup-restore-status.$restoreRunId.ts` — poll; `companyId`
  from `requirePermissions`, so a user can't poll another company's run.
- UI: `modules/settings/ui/Backups/` — `BackupChoices` (Data only / Data + files),
  `BackupSourcePicker`, `BackupProgressModal`, `RestoreReviewRow` (Keep/Revert),
  `BackupContentsInfo` (lazy popover), `format.ts`. `JobProgressModal` tracks real
  completion, not a timer: restore/revert poll the status marker; **export** has no
  marker, so the route component revalidates the list and passes `completed` once
  the new backup actually appears (`exportBaseline` diff) — the dialog never claims
  success before the artifact exists.

## Onboarding seed

`routes/onboarding+/industry.tsx` → `dataChoice: "template" | "import" | "none"`
("Use a demo template" / "Restore from a backup" / "I don't need data"). A demo
template is a committed data-only `.gz` at
`packages/database/supabase/backups/<industryId>.carbon.json.gz` plus a sibling
`<industryId>.assets/` folder of its storage files (one per `industry` row).
`provisionCompanyData` (onboarding.server.ts) imports it on top of an
identity-only seed, **referencing** the shared `_templates/<industryId>/` assets
instead of copying files per company. No file → clean seed.

## CI publish

`ci/src/upload-backup-templates.ts` — **manual, idempotent** (`--force` to
overwrite). Uploads each committed `.gz` to every workspace's `company-templates`
bucket and fans the files from the committed `<industryId>.assets/` folder into
`private/_templates/<industryId>/` (assets live as real files in the sibling
folder, not embedded in the gz). Run via the `Publish backup templates` workflow
(`.github/workflows/publish-templates.yml`, `workflow_dispatch`) or
`pnpm --filter ci ci:upload-backup-templates`. NOT run on every deploy (templates
are large + change rarely). The script hardcodes the `_templates` and `.assets`
literals — keep in sync with `TEMPLATE_ASSET_PREFIX` / `BACKUP_GZ_SUFFIX`.
