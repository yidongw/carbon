## Does the world need another ERP?

We built Carbon after years of building end-to-end manufacturing systems with off-the-shelf solutions. We realized that:

- Modern, API-first tooling didn't exist
- Vendor lock-in bordered on extortion
- There is no "perfect ERP" because each company is unique

We built Carbon to solve these problems ☝️

## Architecture

Carbon is designed to make it easy for you to extend the platform by building your own apps through our API. We provide some examples to get you started in the [examples](https://github.com/crbnos/carbon/blob/main/examples) folder.

## Codebase

The monorepo follows the Turborepo convention of grouping packages into one of two folders.

1. `/apps` for applications
2. `/packages` for shared code

### `/apps`

| Package Name | Description     | Local Command         |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------- |
| `erp`        | ERP Application | `pnpm run dev`         |
| `mes`        | MES             | `pnpm run dev:mes`     |
| `academy`    | Academy         | `pnpm run dev:academy` |
| `starter`    | Starter         | `pnpm run dev:starter` |

### `/packages`

| Package Name        | Description                                                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@carbon/database`  | Database schema, migrations and types                                      |
| `@carbon/documents` | Transactional PDFs and email templates                                     |
| `@carbon/ee`        | Integration definitions and configurations                                 |
| `@carbon/config`    | Shared configuration (vitest, tsconfig, tailwind) across apps and packages |
| `@carbon/jobs`      | Background jobs and workers                                                |
| `@carbon/logger`    | Shared logger used across apps                                             |
| `@carbon/react`     | Shared web-based UI components                                             |
| `@carbon/kv`        | Redis cache client                                                         |

| `@carbon/utils`     | Shared utility functions used across apps and packages                     |

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repo into a public GitHub repository (or fork https://github.com/crbnos/carbon/fork). If want to make the repo private, you should [acquire a commercial license](https://carbon.ms/sales) to comply with the AGPL license.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/crbnos/carbon.git
   ```

2. Go to the project folder

   ```sh
   cd carbon
   ```

Make sure that you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) on your system since this monorepo uses the Docker for local development.

In addition you must configure the following external services:

| Service | Purpose                    | URL                                                            |
| ------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Posthog | Product analytics platform | [https://us.posthog.com/signup](https://us.posthog.com/signup) |
| Stripe | Payments service | [https://dashboard.stripe.com/login](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login) |
| Resend | Email service | [https://resend.com](https://resend.com) |
| Novu | Notifications service | [https://dashboard.novu.co/auth/sign-in](https://dashboard.novu.co/auth/sign-in) |

Posthog has a free tier which should be plenty to support local development. If you're self hosting and you don't want to use Posthog, it's pretty easy to remove the analytics.

### Installation

First download and initialize the repository dependencies.

This repo uses **pnpm** as its package manager. Enable Corepack so the correct pnpm version (pinned via `packageManager` in `package.json`) is used automatically:

```bash
$ corepack enable    # one-time: activates pnpm shim from packageManager field
```

Then install + start the database:

```bash
$ nvm use            # use node v22
$ pnpm install       # install dependencies
$ pnpm run db:start  # pull and run the containers
```

Create an `.env` file and copy the contents of `.env.example` file into it

```bash
$ cp ./.env.example ./.env
```

1. **Social Sign In**: Signing in requires you to setup one of two methods:

- Email requires a Resend API key (you'll set this up later on)
- Sign-in with Google requires a Google auth client with these variables. [See the Supabase docs for instructions on how to set this up](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google):
  - Set `Authorized JavaScript origins` to only `http://127.0.0.1:54321`
  - Set `Authorized redirect URIs` to `http://127.0.0.1:54321/auth/v1/callback`
- You should set environment variables like the following.
  - `SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="******.apps.googleusercontent.com"`
  - `SUPABASE_AUTH_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="GOCSPX-****************"`

2. **Supabase**: Start up the backend services using `pnpm run db:start`. Set the Supabase entries from the CLI output:

- `SUPABASE_URL` — **Project URL** (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:54321`)
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — the **Publishable** key (`sb_publishable_...`). Older CLI versions labeled this the anon key (`eyJ...`).
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — the **Secret** key (`sb_secret_...`). Older CLI versions labeled this the service_role key.

Alternatively, run `supabase status -o env` in `packages/database` (or your Supabase project directory) for machine-readable lines, including legacy JWT-style anon/service keys if your CLI still prints them.

See [Supabase API keys](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/api-keys) for how publishable and secret keys relate to the legacy names.

3. **Redis** (Caching): Set up a Redis instance (local or cloud) and add the connection URL. You can set one up in the cloud easily using [Upstash](https://console.upstash.com/auth/sign-in):

- `REDIS_URL=[redis://user:password@host:port]`

4. **Posthog** (Analytics): In Posthog go to [https://[region].posthog.com/project/[project-id]/settings/project-details](https://[region].posthog.com/project/[project-id]/settings/project-details) to find your Project ID and Project API key:

- `POSTHOG_API_HOST=[https://[region].posthog.com]`
- `POSTHOG_PROJECT_PUBLIC_KEY=[Project API Key starting 'phc*']`

5. **Stripe** (Payment service) - [Create a stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login), add a `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` from the Stripe `Settings > Developers` interface

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_*************"`

6. **Resend** (Email service) - [Create a Resend account](https://resend.com) and configure:

- `RESEND_API_KEY="re_**********"`
- `RESEND_DOMAIN="carbon.ms"` (or your domain, no trailing slashes or protocols)
- `RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID="*****"` (Optional - required for contact management in `packages/jobs`)

Resend is used for transactional emails (user invitations, email verification, onboarding). All three variables are stored in `packages/auth/src/config/env.ts`.

7. **Novu** (In-app notifications) - [Create a Novu account](https://dashboard.novu.co/auth/sign-in) and configure:

- `NOVU_APPLICATION_ID="********************"` (Client-side, public)
- `NOVU_SECRET_KEY="********************"` (Server-side secret, backend only)

Novu is used for in-app notifications and notification workflows. After standing up the application and tunnelling port 3000, sync your Novu workflows:

```bash
pnpm run novu:sync
```

This command syncs your Novu workflows with the Carbon application using the bridge URL.

Finally, start the apps and packages:

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
$ pnpm run dev:mes        # pnpm run dev in all apps & packages
```

After installation you should be able run the apps locally.
| Application     | URL                                                                                                                |

### Code Formatting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code formatting and linting. To set up automatic formatting on save in VS Code:

1. Install the [Biome VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)

2. Add the following to your VS Code settings (`.vscode/settings.json` or global settings):

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.organizeImports.biome": "explicit",
  "source.fixAll.biome": "explicit"
},
"editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome"
```

### Commands

To add an edge function

```bash
$ pnpm run db:function:new <name>
```

To add a database migration

```bash
$ pnpm run db:migrate:new <name>
```

To add an AI agent

```bash
$ pnpm run agent:new <name>
```

To add an AI tool

```bash
$ pnpm run tool:new <name>
```

To kill the database containers in a non-recoverable way, you can run:

```bash
$ pnpm run db:kill   # stop and delete all database containers
```

To restart and reseed the database, you can run:

```bash
$ pnpm run db:build # runs db:kill, db:start, and setup
```

To run a particular application, use the `-w workspace` flag.

For example, to run test command in the `@carbon/react` package you can run:

```
$ pnpm --filter @carbon/react test
```

To restore a production database locally:

1. Download the production database as a .backup file
2. Rename the `migrations` folder to `_migrations`
3. Restore the database with the following command:

```bash
$ pnpm run db:build # this should error out at the seed step
$ PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h localhost -p 54322 -U supabase_admin -d postgres < ~/Downloads/db_cluster-17-11-2025@09-03-36.backup
$ pnpm run dev
```

4. Rename the `_migraitons` folder back to `migrations`

## API

The API documentation is located in the ERP app at `${ERP}/x/api/js/intro`. It is auto-generated based on changes to the database.

There are two ways to use the API:

1. From another codebase using a supabase client library:

- [Javascript](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/introduction)
- [Flutter](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/introduction)
- [Python](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/python/introduction)
- [C#](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/csharp/introduction)
- [Swift](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/swift/introduction)
- [Kotlin](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/kotlin/introduction)

2. From within the codebase using our packages.

### From another Codebase

First, set up the necessary credentials in environment variables. For the example below:

1. Navigate to settings in the ERP to generate an API key. Set this in `CARBON_API_KEY`
2. Get the Supabase URL to call (this is `SUPABASE_URL` in your `.env` if hosting locally, e.g. http://localhost:54321). Set this as `CARBON_API_URL`.
3. Get the `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` e.g. from your .env file. Set this as `CARBON_PUBLIC_KEY`.

If you're self-hosting you can also use the supabase service key instead of the public key for root access. In that case you don't need to include the `carbon-key` header.

```ts
import { Database } from "@carbon/database";
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const apiKey = process.env.CARBON_API_KEY;
const apiUrl = process.env.CARBON_API_URL;
const publicKey = process.env.CARBON_PUBLIC_KEY;

const carbon = createClient<Database>(apiUrl, publicKey, {
  global: {
    headers: {
      "carbon-key": apiKey,
    },
  },
});

// returns items from the company associated with the api key
const { data, error } = await carbon.from("item").select("*");
```

### From the Monorepo

```tsx
import { getCarbonServiceRole } from "@carbon/auth/client.server";
const carbon = getCarbonServiceRole();

// returns all items across companies
const { data, error } = await carbon.from("item").select("*");

// returns items from a specific company
const companyId = "xyz";
const { data, error } = await carbon
  .from("item")
  .select("*")
  .eq("companyId", companyId);
```


## Translations

In order to run `pnpm run translate` you must first run:

```bash
brew install ollama
brew services start ollama
ollama pull llama3.2
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
npx linguito config set \
  llmSettings.provider=ollama \
  llmSettings.url=http://127.0.0.1:11434/api
```
## Migration Notes

### Trigger.dev to Inngest

Background jobs have been migrated from [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev) to [Inngest](https://inngest.com). Key changes:

- **Job definitions** moved from `packages/jobs/trigger/` to `packages/jobs/src/inngest/functions/`
- **Triggering jobs** from app code uses `trigger()` and `batchTrigger()` from `@carbon/jobs` instead of `tasks.trigger()` from `@trigger.dev/sdk`
- **Inngest dev server** runs via `npx inngest-cli@latest dev -u http://localhost:3000/api/inngest`
- **Environment variables**: `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY`, `TRIGGER_API_URL`, and `TRIGGER_PROJECT_ID` are no longer needed. Set `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` and `INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY` instead (not required for local dev).

### Upstash to Local Redis

The caching layer (`@carbon/kv`) no longer depends on Upstash. A standard Redis instance is used instead. The `REDIS_URL` environment variable still applies, but you can point it at any Redis-compatible server (including a local Docker container).
