/* Single source of truth for status enum → UI color across Carbon. The ERP renders
 * these via `@carbon/react`'s <Status color> (and Badge variants); the docs site renders
 * a colored dot from the same map, so the documentation can't drift from the app.
 *
 * Colors are the 7 semantic names the Status/Badge components accept — framework-agnostic,
 * so the standalone docs site can consume them too. `STATUS_COLOR_HEX` gives a representative
 * solid hex per name (matching the Status/Badge hues) for a dot/indicator.
 *
 * Each entity's map is grounded in its ERP `*Status.tsx` component; that component imports its
 * map from here (keeping its own icon / display-text / conditional logic). */
