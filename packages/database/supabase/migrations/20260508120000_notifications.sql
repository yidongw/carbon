-- In-app notification store. Replaces Novu cloud storage so we own the data
-- and can stream changes to clients via Supabase Realtime instead of Novu's
-- WebSocket service.
--
-- Grouping model: notifications can be flat or grouped under a "digest" row.
-- A digest is itself a notification row (event = "digest"); its children point
-- to it via "digestedInto". The user-facing list renders only top-level rows
-- (digestedInto IS NULL) — digests render as expandable groups, everything
-- else renders as a single leaf. See the partial index below, which mirrors
-- this filter so unread/digest queries stay cheap.
