 * The single owner of the loop artifact layout. Every loop path is constructed

 *   .ai/runs/<id>/        one loop run's artifacts
 *     binding.loop.md     the binding the run was driven from          — COMMITTED
 *     ledger.jsonl        append-only per-iteration record             — COMMITTED
 *     outcome.json        the final LoopOutcome (machine-readable)     — COMMITTED
 *     run.log.jsonl       full event log (verbose, ephemeral)          — GITIGNORED
 *     screenshots/        behavior-gate captures (ephemeral)           — GITIGNORED
 *
 * Durable files (binding, ledger, outcome) are committed back to main after
 * each build so any agent can inspect history and resume partial work without
 * needing the original worktree. Volatile files (run.log, screenshots) are
 * gitignored to keep the product tree clean.
 *
 * `.ai/runs/` also holds committed markdown run logs from the plan/execute
 * skills — `pruneRuns` (see runs.ts) has one place to GC.
