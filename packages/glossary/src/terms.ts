/**
 * The Carbon glossary — one source of truth for term definitions, used by both
 * the docs site's inline <Term> popovers and the ERP/MES field-help affordance.
 *
 * Keys are slugs (lowercase, hyphenated). Author usage in docs MDX:
 *   <Term>purchase to order</Term>          — slugifies the text to find the entry
 *   <Term id="purchase-to-order">bought</Term> — explicit key when display text differs
 *
 * `term` and `definition` are Lingui `msg` descriptors so the extractor picks
 * them up and ERP/MES translate them at render via `i18n._()`. Consumers
 * without a Lingui runtime (docs Next.js) read the source English off
 * `descriptor.message` — see `getTermText` / `getDefinitionText` in `helpers.ts`.
 *
 * Definitions are deliberately short: one crisp, grounded sentence to identify the
 * term — the full story lives behind the "Learn more" link. `href` (optional) points
 * that link at the exact section that explains the term, not just the page top; omit
 * it for terms with no home yet (popover still shows the definition). Anchors are
 * grounded against real headings in docs/content — fix them if a heading is renamed.
 * Enum values verified:
 *   methodType            → "Make to Order" | "Purchase to Order" | "Pull from Inventory"
 *                           (packages/database/.../20260321143847_method-type-migration.sql)
 *   itemReplenishmentSystem → "Buy" | "Make" | "Buy and Make"
 *                           (packages/database/.../20230330024716_parts.sql)
