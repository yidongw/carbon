# Planning (MRP)

> How demand turns into suggested jobs and purchase orders — and where that ends and scheduling begins.

Planning answers one question: *what should we make or buy, and how much?* Carbon's MRP looks at everything you owe and everything you have coming, and turns the gap into suggested orders that you choose to act on.

Without planning you'd reorder by hand. MRP nets demand against supply across the whole bill of materials, so a shortfall on a top-level robot surfaces as the right quantity of every component, offset for its lead time — before you're caught short.

## Two stages

Planning runs in two distinct passes, and conflating them is the usual mistake:

1. **MRP, explode and net.** The engine explodes demand through bills of material, nets it against on-hand plus open jobs and purchase orders, and writes period-bucketed demand and supply forecasts. It does **not** apply reorder points and does **not** create orders.
2. **Planning views, suggest a quantity.** The production and purchasing planning pages read those forecasts, project running stock week by week, and apply each item's **reorder policy** to propose a quantity to order.

MRP **suggests, it never auto-orders.** The engine only writes forecasts; turning a suggestion into a real job or PO is an explicit action you take on the planning page.

## What feeds it

| Input | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Customer demand | Open sales-order lines, by promised date. |
| Production demand | Job material still to issue, offset by lead time. |
| Forecast demand | Manually entered demand projections. |
| Open supply | Open jobs and open purchase-order lines. |
| On hand | The item ledger balance. |

## Reorder policy

Each item, per location, carries a **reordering policy** that decides how a suggestion is sized: *Manual Reorder* (suggests nothing), *Demand-Based Reorder* (the default), *Fixed Reorder Quantity*, or *Maximum Quantity*. Each is tuned by reorder point, order quantity, accumulation period, and min/max/multiple rounding. See `docs/reference/reordering` for the parameters in full.

## From suggestion to order

An item's **replenishment system** routes where its shortfall shows up: *Make* items surface on the production planning page as suggested jobs, *Buy* items on the purchasing page as suggested POs. Choosing **Order** creates a real job or purchase order at status **"Planned"** — persisted from planning, but not yet released into the normal lifecycle.

**"Planned"** is a real, saved job or PO that came from a planning suggestion and is waiting to be released — distinct from a hand-started **"Draft"**.

## Planning vs scheduling

Planning decides *what and how much*; **scheduling** decides *when and where*. Once a job exists, the scheduling engine places its operations onto work centers and computes their dates — it never changes quantities. The two are separate subsystems that meet at the job: planning finalizes it, scheduling sequences it onto the floor.

## Troubleshooting

### "Manufacturing is blocked for item …"
Ordering a suggested job was stopped because that item's planning settings have manufacturing blocked. Clear the flag on the item, then order again from planning.

### "Manufacturing requires configuration for item …"
The item is configurable, and planning can't supply a configuration. Create the job from a context that sets the configuration (for example the sales order line) instead of from the planning page.

### "Failed to create job method for item …"
The job was created but copying the item's method into it failed — usually the item has no **Active** make method. Activate a method on the item, then delete and re-order the job (or run Get Method on it).

### "Failed to load any locations"
Planning needs at least one location. Create one in settings and set a default.
