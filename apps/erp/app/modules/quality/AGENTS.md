# Quality Module

Non-conformances (issues/NCRs), corrective/preventive actions (CAPAs), gauge management and calibration, quality documents, inspection documents with balloon annotations, inbound inspections with AQL sampling plans, and risk registers.

## Key Domain Concepts

- **Issue (NCR)** — non-conformance record. Statuses: Registered → In Progress → Closed. `isIssueLocked(status)` returns true for Closed. Has 10+ association types (items, customers, suppliers, job operations, PO/SO lines, shipment/receipt lines, tracked entities, inbound inspections).
- **Issue Workflow** — configurable multi-step workflow with action tasks (`nonConformanceActionTask`) and approval tasks (`nonConformanceApprovalTask`). Required actions have `systemType` (Containment, Corrective, Preventive, Verification, Communication) — system actions are protected by trigger.
- **Inspection Document** — PDF-based drawing with balloon annotations linking to inspection features (dimensions with nominal/tolerance values). Used for FAI and in-process inspection. MUST use `saveInspectionDocumentAtomic` RPC for atomic saves.
- **Inbound Inspection** — lot-level inspection triggered on receipt for items with `requiresInspection = true`. Uses AQL-based sampling plans (ANSI Z1.4 / ISO 2859-1). Tracked entities post as `On Hold` until disposition.
- **Gauge** — measurement instrument with calibration tracking. Statuses: Active/Inactive. Roles: Master/Standard.
- **Disposition** — per-item outcome on an NCR. Values include Pending, Return to Supplier, Rework, Scrap, Use As Is (subset active in UI).
- **Risk Register** — risks and opportunities tracked by source (Customer, Supplier, Item, Job, etc.). Severity and likelihood are independent 1–5 ratings with no computed score.

## Safety

### Always
- MUST check `isIssueLocked(status)` before allowing edits — Closed issues are locked.
- MUST use `deleteIssueAssociation` with the `type` parameter for managing NCR links — it handles 10+ association types via `nonConformanceAssociationType`.
- MUST scope all queries by `companyId`.
- MUST use `saveInspectionDocumentAtomic` RPC for inspection document saves — it handles balloons and features atomically.

### Ask First
- Closing issues that have incomplete required actions or pending approval tasks.
- Deleting inspection documents that have recorded measurements.
- Deactivating gauges with active calibration records.

### Never
- Delete gauges with calibration records — deactivate instead (`deactivateGauge`).
- Bypass workflow task/approval requirements when closing an issue.
- Hard-delete issue workflows — use `deleteIssueWorkflow` which handles deactivation.
- Introduce a `score` column on risk register — severity and likelihood are kept separate by design.

## Key Data Model

| Table / View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `nonConformance` / `issues` (view) | Issue/NCR header: status, priority, source, type, assignee, containmentStatus |
| `nonConformanceType` / `nonConformanceWorkflow` | Issue categories and workflow definitions |
| `nonConformanceRequiredAction` | Actions required before closure (with `systemType`) |
| `nonConformanceActionTask` / `nonConformanceApprovalTask` | Workflow task instances |
| `nonConformanceItem` | Issue-to-item junction with `disposition` |
| `nonConformanceCustomer` / `...Supplier` / `...JobOperation` / `...PurchaseOrderLine` / `...ReceiptLine` / `...ShipmentLine` / `...TrackedEntity` / `...InboundInspection` | Association tables (10+ types) |
| `inspectionDocument` | PDF drawing with balloon overlay |
| `inboundInspection` / `inboundInspectionSample` | Lot-level receipt inspection with sampling |
| `itemSamplingPlan` | AQL sampling plan per item |
| `gauge` / `gaugeCalibrationRecord` / `gaugeType` | Measurement instrument tracking |
| `qualityDocument` / `qualityDocumentStep` | Versioned SOPs with ordered steps |
| `riskRegister` / `riskRegisters` (view) | Risk/opportunity tracking by source |

## Key Service Functions

- `getIssue` / `getIssues` — NCR reads; `getIssues` reads `issues` view with computed `containmentStatus`
- `getIssueAssociations` / `getIssueItems` / `getIssueReviewers` — NCR details and associations
- `getIssueWorkflow` / `getIssueActionTasks` / `getIssueApprovalTasks` — workflow state
- `updateIssueStatus` / `updateIssueTaskStatus` — status transitions
- `getInspectionDocument` / `getBalloons` / `getInspectionFeatures` / `getInspectionPlan` — drawing inspection
- `getInboundInspection` / `getInboundInspections` / `getInboundInspectionLotTrackedEntities` — receipt inspections
- `getGauge` / `getGauges` / `getGaugeCalibrationRecords` — gauge management
- `getRisk` / `getRisks` / `upsertRisk` / `updateRiskStatus` — risk register
- `getQualityDocument` / `getQualityDocumentSteps` — versioned SOPs
- `getQualityActions` — corrective/preventive action reads
- `upsertItemSamplingPlan` — per-item AQL sampling plan configuration
